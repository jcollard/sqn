<p align="left"> <font color="#CC0000" size="3" face="Verdana">Announcements:<font size="2"><br>
  </font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">I love end of the year updates!
  I hope you all have had an enjoyable peaceful Christmas this year. Happy new
  year to you all! I wish you all God's speed, good luck, wealth, health and
  all the other nonsense that comes with it. Now, back to Space Quest related
  stuff. I'm sure you dropped by because of that.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Looking back at this year one can 
  only conclude it's been a most exciting one. We've had many rumours and news 
  about that possible new Space Quest game (rumoured to be created by Escape Factory). 
  And, if you take a look at this site news archive you can see it had over 40 
  official updates this year (and a LOT more &quot;behind the scenes&quot; updates, 
  let me tell you), which comes down to one update every 8 or 9 days. For a Space 
  Quest fansite, this is indeed saying something. I don't know if I'll meet that 
  quota next year, but I'll surely try (I've got enough idea's for at least half 
  a year).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Firstly:</strong> I would
    like to announce that I'm working on moving my site to a new server which
    offers more disk space and more bandwidth. This explains at least a part
    of my update-less-behavior as it has taken up much of my free time (along
    with editing the new FAQ: you'll read about that later).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Secondly:</strong> I'm
    working on one or two interesting Space Quest updates. Sadly, these things
    are out of my hands because they are made by other people. I've been promising
    you guys one or two big updates since October, and let's hope they will come
    soon enough... As soon as &quot;my people&quot; start delivering that is
    :)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> As Space
    Quest fan, you must have heard at least something about the SQFAQ (Space
    Quest Frequently Asked Questions). It's a massive document made by Troels
    Pleimert (the latest version, being version 2, was released years ago) and
    is considered to be the Space Quest Bible (although its gotten a little bit
    outdated on some points). It contains nearly everything you can think of:
    hints, funfacts, eastereggs and much more. Sadly, Troels stopped working
    on it when Space Quest 7 was cancelled back in February 1999.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some days ago I've received a mail
    from Troels asking me to continue his work and revive the FAQ. I've agreed
    to take over the FAQ and I've already started working on creating the next
    version of it, which will be version 3. Needless to say, I feel honored Troels
    asked me to continue &quot;the Space Quest Bible&quot;. The task that lays
    ahead is a HUGE one, and it brings quite some responsibility with it. I'll
    do my best to make the next version of the FAQ (and future versions to come)
    a success. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've set up a message board as communication 
  line with the fans. Feel free to post your own additions for the new FAQ. These 
  additions can be discussed: whether they make a good addition to the new FAQ 
  or not. The board can also be used to discuss the old FAQ. Every input from 
  fans is welcome. Also, I'll make polls about idea's I'm having on that message 
  board. You can vote either for or against it, and discuss why you (don't) like 
  it. I'll use the information of the final outcome of these polls whether or 
  not to put that idea into the new FAQ. I hope to receive loads of input from 
  you all. The more the better. Click here to go to the message board.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you haven't got a clue what the 
  SQFAQ is, I suggest you to download it and start reading until your mom notices 
  you haven't been downstairs for two whole days.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC0000" size="3" face="Verdana">Site updates:<strong><font size="2"><br>
  </font></strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>- The entire Space
  Quest 1 section has been edited<br>
  </strong>This sounds like I've done a HUGE update, but I didn't :). What I DID, 
  however, was updating the sq1 goodies page, which now features a ton of cool 
  new stuff. Check it out, it's worth it. The rest was really nothing more or 
  less but all kind of small things, like removing typo's and changing some graphics. 
  I wanted to add more screenshots, but when I looked at the page I thought there 
  were enough already. If you disagree, feel free to send in your favorite SQ1 
  (either EGA or VGA) screenshots and I might or might not add them.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>- A wicked new Space Quest
      4 funfact has been added</strong><br>
  Neil Matz was a programmer for Space Quest 4. He popped out of nowhere and began 
  to post these shocking messages on the TalkSpot. Check out the Space Quest 4

  The entire space Quest 7 section has been revamped. The page about the cancelled

  have been made and I hope it's worth a visit. Also, I've updated the news and

  only hours later a Space Quest fan who calls himself &quot;Holodude&quot; dug 
  up some nice additions. Boy, this means night work again for me! On July 27th 
  this year, SpaceQuest.Net published news about a mysterious clay model which 
  is supposed to be a possible character for the new Space Quest game. Holodude, 
  a guy over at the Subspace Channel, dug up these two pictures from the </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Escape 
  Factory</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> website. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Left is our good old Keebo, but 
  this time &quot;uncensored&quot;. The picture on the right are two guys presumably 
  called Rick (not sure if he's an Escape Factory employee) and Ed Allard (co-founder 
  and lead designer of Escape Factory). Click on the images for a close up and 
  notice the Keebo character drawing just behind Ed. (or Rick, I'm not sure). 
  If this is the first time you heard about such a clay model, then check the 
  Space Quest 7 news and rumors page.</font></p>

  for some of the Space Quest games and an &quot;ORDER NOW&quot; link to a page 
  on the Amazon store that offers the Space Quest Collection (Amazon takes care 
  of Sierra's online sales). The collection is still out of stock, but I wouldn't 
  be surprised to see it becoming available in the next couple of weeks. I'm extremely

    heard either good or bad news about a possible Space Quest 7 lately, I think
    this is great news indeed. Sierra is putting time (and thus money) into the
    Space Quest series again! With the Space Quest Collection being put back
    on the virtual shelves soon, there is reason to believe Sierra is working
    on something exciting. I wouldn't be surprised if they announced something

  </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, this is actually the first site
  update since half a month, and I'm glad to say it's Space Quest 6 stuff only!
  So, what's new?<br>
    <br>
  - The character database page , screenshots page and inventory items page all 
  contain information from the start of the game, until Roger gets saved by Stellar. 
  Of course, these pages will be more complete in the future.<br>
  - A complete pointlist page for Space Quest 6 AND a Space Quest 6 map page! 
  Very cool indeed!<br>
  - A goodies page, that basically contains the content of the &quot;neat picture&quot; 
  page you guys might have seen before. Some cool stuff will be added to this 
  page in the future too.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  - And now for the final bang, the Space Quest 6 Manual page has been updated! 
  It now contains the rare quickstart manual. A very cool looking SQ item, indeed!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#3300FF">New Sierra chat
    world announced!<br>
    <font size="2">-- It will be something like we've never seen before --</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Martin Kool, dreamer by trade, woke up in the
    middle of the night in early January 2002 with a truly cosmic concept. He
    had an idea that enabled Space Questers to chat with each other inside the
    original rooms of the first two Space Quest games. A visitor would control
    a Sierra hero and would be able to talk with other fans already present in
    a room AND be able to walk his character all across the screen, around objects
    and into other screens, just like in the real games...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lucky for us, this idea didn't stop there. Only
    a few hours after this wicked idea popped up inside his twisted mind like
    a nasty pop up ad that can not be closed in anyway, Martin had already made
    a working prototype of his project, not very originally codenamed &quot;Space
    Quest Online&quot;. But to hell with the name!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Today, your lovely looking webmaster had the
    unique chance to experience an early working beta version of what will be
    the world's default chatroom for all Sierra fans, not just the Space Questers.
    The project will probably be finished somewhere in the end of this year.
    By then, it will not only feature Space Quest screens and characters, but
    other Sierra AGI games as well, like the Black Cauldron, Leisure Suit Larry
    and King's Quest. You'll also have an option to create your own characters.
    So, if your all-time-favorite Sarien guard isn't available to pick, you'll
    be able to make it yourself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When it's finished, the whole Sierra community 
  will be able to chat with each other in one big world, with an enormous amount 
  of screens to choose from. Be Roger, and go looking for other Space Quest fans 
  in that Ulence Flats Bar... Or, walk from the Space Quest world into the Leisure 
  Suit Larry world! Change your character into Larry and try to score some babes 
  inside Lefty's Bar! Martin has plans to have at least 20 to 30 working screens 
  PER AGI GAME for the first public release. A nice note for hungry Space Questers: 
  you'll be able to walk through the ENTIRE Sarien Encounter computer game, meeting 
  other Space Quest and Sierra fans as you travel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The chatroom will be accessed through a special
    website. The project has already been tested on the popular Internet Explorer
    browsers and will work with version 5 and up. It will also Mozilla 1 and
    allthough it has not been tested yet, I guess it will also work with the
    Netscape and Opera browsers as well. Click on the image you see here somewhere
    on the left for a close up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> It truly opened my eyes. The option to make 
  your own screens means I (for instance) can make a special SpaceQuest.Net screen 
  for my site, in which you can walk with your Space Quest Character from my site, 
  right into the Space Quest world from Martin... Or if you wish, the Leisure 
  Suit Larry world. Of course, if you think of this concept a little bit, the 
  possibilities are endless.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's still a lot work to be done, as Martin
    explains: &quot;I'm sure you understand that I will not release any buggy
    alpha version with half-baked locations and no gameplay, so the rest of the
    fans will just have to wait until the job is done.&quot; And I guess humans
    with the IQ of at least 30 and up will understand that. He has asked for
    people who would like/love to aid him in his work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This project will definitely change the way how 
  Sierra fans communicate with each other. SpaceQuest.Net will keep you updated 
  of any new developments.</font></p>

    about Space Quest 7. Mr. Ryder did not have the chance to reply to my mail

    from the official Space Quest 7 team reveiled!<br>
    <font size="2">-- Sierra uses Sculpey clay: ICF (International Clay Federation)
    shocked --</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before you guys get all excited, 
  I want to add Sierra hasn't officially announced Space Quest 7. <i>Adventure 
  Gamers</i> has just released yet another article about the rumored Space Quest 
  7! The following part is copied from it:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Our informant couldn&#146;t
    say anything about the genre orientation of the game, but did say that it
    is being created at a new Seattle-based independent developer. Our secret
    operatives (cough-Google-cough) even uncovered this highly classified clay
    model (see picture) for a possible character in the game. Naturally, we blocked
    his eyes to ensure his anonymity. At least, I think those are his eyes. (By
    the way, his name is Keebo... oops!)&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Source: Adventure Gamers and the 
  Virtual Broomcloset</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I must say there's a fishy smell 
  hanging around this &quot;so called&quot; clay figure. No no, not literally... 
  You see, &quot;Sculpey&quot; offers &quot;do it yourself&quot; clay packages. 
  The box of clay here to the left is the same as you can see in the so-called 
  &quot;model&quot; photo. What I don't understand is, why would Sierra wants 
  to use &quot;Sculpey clay&quot; for their models? Why would Sierra wants to 
  make a claymodel for a computer game, anyway? Blimey, why would Sierra wants 
  to make a clayfigure for a character when the project is still in its infancy? 
  And what's with the eyes? Why would <i>Adventure Gamers</i> want to &quot;censor&quot; 
  them? Maybe because they are &quot;ears&quot; and not &quot;eyes&quot;. I personally 
  think this so-called &quot;classified clay model&quot; COULD BE a very bad joke 
  from <i>Adventure Gamers</i>. And giving people false hope sure seems like a 
  bad joke to me. What do you think? Is it a cheap fraud, or is it hot Space Quest 
  7 stuff?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jess Morrissette, webmaster of <i>The 
  Virtual Broomcloset</i>, explains: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The more I thought about
    it, the more I began to wonder about the model myself. It wasn't so much
    the model itself or the timing of its appearance, but rather the manner in
    which it was presented in the Adventure Gamers article. It was a little difficult
    to determine what was serious in that article and what was a joke.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, I e-mailed Marek --the
    big cheese at Adventure Gamers-- earlier today, and he assured me that the
    model is legit. So, at this point, I think it's safe to assume that either
    it's the real deal, or both we and Adventure Gamers have been scammed.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christina, a member of both <i>Adventure 
  Gamers</i> and <i>The TSN forums</i>, gives us some more information about the 
  clay:<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The reason for using Sculpey
    is this. The game isn't being created by Sierra (as was stated in the article).
    It is being done by a Seattle based company and it will then be distributed
    by Sierra. This new developer is very new and young. I'm no expert on models/3d
    games but I'm pretty sure the reason for making a model is to scan it into
    3D data. All the SQ stuff in the article is confirmed by the developer making
    it. Unfortunately though we haven't been given permission yet to say who
    it is.&quot;</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A quick Glance in the discussion 
    board of the &quot;<i>Aliens Stole My Plunger</i>&quot; project confirms the 
    rumors about a possible restart of the project. FunkieDaMouse, the lead programmer 
    of the project, explains:<br>
  </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The project is officially 
    back in production! We have changed to a new engine, Crystal Space. We will 
    be using the isometric engine (no perspective) for that &quot;cartoony&quot; 
    feel. CS supplies many useful plugins for music and graphics formats, as well 
    as a windowing system that should make the interface extremely easy to make, 
    and it's completely skinnable! CS also allows the game to be cross-platform, 
    which means we can also build it for Linux, BeOS, NeXT, Sun, and even mac. 
    :-P It also supports OpenGL and DirectX as well as normal Software rendering. 
    <br>
        <br>
    The requirements for the game have changed a bit as a result of this. The
    music can be in almost any format except Midi. (ogg vorbis, mp3, mod/it/s3m/xt,
    wav, etc...) The levels will need to be created in 3D instead of as graphics
    (contact me for information on the level format), and graphics for the characters
    and objects can be in a variety of formats. (bmp,gif,jng,jpg,png,sgi,tga,wal)
    Video and animations can be in AVI or DivX format. <br>
        <br>
    We should have a very nice-looking and playable game by the time we're done
    here... <br>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Danny Bloks (a Dutch Space Quester) has announced 
    not one, but two (!!!) new fanprojects. The first one is called &quot;<i>Space 
    Quest - The Prequels</i>&quot; which will actually be made up of two complete 
    games (if all goes well). Project Leader Danny Bloks told me the story of 
    his first Prequel, &quot;<i>Space Quest -2: The Xenonian Corruption</i>&quot;, 
    (which will feature 2-D graphics) has already been written. He has drafted 
    a nice team of talented individuals who will be helping realizing his game. 
    Danny will be writing some songs for it and will be coordinating the whole 
    process of his team (read: he'll be slapping his programmers and artists if 
    they can't meet the impossible deadlines). More information about &quot;<i>Space 
    Quest -2: The Xenonian Corruption</i>&quot; and the &quot;<i>Prequels</i>&quot; 
    in general can be found at their website: http://prequels.spacequest.net.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Further more, Danny announced &quot;<i>The 
    Rebellion Saga</i>&quot;. Not much information has been released at this time 
    but it looks like this could be a series too. The game will feature 3-D rendered 
    graphics. Menbailee, the mastermind behind his &quot;<i>Goliath Series</i>&quot;, 
    will be working on &quot;<i>The Rebellion Saga</i>&quot; as a graphical artist 
    and co-writer. Danny also told me a trailer will be released in the near future. 
    Looks like these guys have got their hands full these days! More information

  Space Quest 6 soundtrack, containing over 64MB's of songs are there! Enjoy.<br>

  update to Katharine Bennewitz and Joshua Cunningham for their great donations. 
  Thanks guys! You too can help support SpaceQuest.Net. The more donations I get, 
  the more server space and bandwidth I can afford, which basically means even 
  more cool downloads and Space Quest stuff for you!<br>
  - Another FAT update! A bunch of scans from several InterAction Magazines. The 
  scans are shattered all over my site (mainly in the goodies page, though). To 
  help you find all the cool scans, I suggest you to check out this page. It's 
  just too much to mention on the main page here.<br>
  - Justas and Les Anderson have submitted the first few words for the Space Quest 
  3 puzzle!<br>
  - As you might have noticed, I've changed the subtext of my banner. What do
  you think?<br>

  <font face="Verdana" size="2">A turning point in the very old but still living 
  history of the Space Quest Fan World is in the making. Florian Heise, known 
  throughout the Andromeda Galaxy as webmaster of the long dead StarCon 3000 The 
  Next Mutation website is going to write weekly articles about the Space Quest 
  Fan History. Having noticed that the Space Quest Fans of today are feeling very 
  nostalgic about the online community before Chainsaw Monday, Florian decided 
  to take up his quill and write all about it. Can you remember that little site 
  called Wilco Burger? Can you still remember the famous names &quot;Sterling 
  Jones&quot; or the mysterious &quot;Sleeray&quot;? Florian will tell you about 
  his experience of the online Space Quest community, the changes it has gone 
  through, the people he has met and lost, the projects that have started and 
  the projects that have died, the fun and fights we've had, and all that kind 
  of useless crap, nobody even wants to take a look at, let alone read! His articles 
  will be posted exclusively at the new SpaceQuest.Net Miscellaneous section on 
  every Sunday, called Space Quest Ramblings!</font></p>

  - Thanks to all the people who reported errors, missing links and corrupted 
  files. Keep 'm coming! The most important error was just reported by Axeman99. 
  The Space Quest 6 Popular Janitronics chapter should work now. Some files were 
  corrupt. I've also fixed the cool Thoreen song at the download page, which didn't 
  work, along with 1001 small other things.<br>
  - Be sure to check out my site next Sunday, I've got a nice surprise for the
  old timers of the Space Quest Community among us.</font></p>

  . Don't be an asshole, and report them to me, please.<br>
  - Uploaded way better scans of the Space Quest 4 and 5 manuals.<br>

  - Even more news, this time from Game Spot. Do take a look. Keep your pants
  on, though. The game hasn't been announced by Sierra (yet). It might as well
  be (even more) wild rumors.<br>
  - Also, my sources told me AdventureGamers.com will reveal the biggest story
  of them all in the very near future. Rumors are that Sierra isn't going to
  make the game itself, but that it will be made by an independent studio, according
  to AdventureGamers.com. <br>
  - You can always mail me to get your answers answered. And visit http://www.sierra-online.com/news/
  for more information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - Everybody is talking about that &quot;new&quot; logo
    Sierra made on their Space Quest website at http://www.sierra.com/games/spacequest/.
    Not to be an asshole, but that logo was used in the Space Quest Collection,
    15th anniversary edition, back in 1994. Click on the image for a larger view.
    So sorry if I shattered that part of your dream. </font></p>

  - This is it, fellow fans! Sierra is definitely up to something. It seems that
  a NEW SPACE QUEST GAME has been CONFIRMED by Adventure Gamers. To be honest,
  I don't know how reliable this source is. Why don't you just go find it out
  yourself? To get the latest news/rumors etc, visit The SubSpace Channel. DO
  post your own questions if you want. You can also email me if you wish. Also,
  another great source of information can be found here: http://www.sierra-online.com/news/.
  Do check back. Don't you just stand there! BOMB Sierra with your questions,
  NOW! Spread the word, ladies. I don't know what's going on, but there is really
  something happening here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">- You have seen http://www.sierra.com/games/spacequest/
    already, right? This tells us they are going to sell the games again. Why
    else would they have made this page? We all know Sierra stopped selling Space
    Quest for quite some time now. Why the sudden change?</font></p>

  - Extremely good news for you all! Sierra seems to have plans to sell Space
  Quest again! Take a look at this page: http://www.sierra.com/games/spacequest/.
  Surely, they aren't going to waste webspace, time and money to make that page
  if they aren't going to do anything with it right?<br>
