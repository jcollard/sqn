  (webmaster of the Ulence Flats website) comments: &quot;... Boy is it right. 
  The man shooting Roger Wilco represents CUC. CUC is the company that owns Sierra 
  (at that time -ed) and they are responsible for canceling Space Quest 7. They 
  didn't think enough people want it to be made, that's why we have to prove otherwise 
  and show that we want Space Quest! This cartoon is excellent, not because of 
  Roger Wilco bleeding dead at the feet of CUC, but because this is exactly how 
  it is. It's really like that, CUC stopping Space Quests 7 and killing Roger 
  Wilco.&quot;</font></p>
