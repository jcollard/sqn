      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I've
          been extremely busy since the start of 2005 and it looks like this
          is only the beginning. The workload of my school is really piling up.
          I spend around 60 to 80 hours each week on school stuff. Yeah, you
          heard me right. Though don't be sorry for me. I really enjoy it, but
          it consumes a bucket load of energy. It's therefore not very surprising
          that my available time for <img src="extraimages/sqnet.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="87" height="11"> is
          almost non-existing. I'm afraid things will get worse in the future.
          I'll be trying to start my very own company somewhere in the third
          quarter this year. Excuse me for sounding over-dramatic, but it looks
          as though my youth has come to an end. Blimey, it took me a fair few
          years! You may have concluded by now what the implications are for <img src="extraimages/sqnet.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="87" height="11">.
          Rest assured, I won't stop updating. But I must ask you for more patience.
          Updates will be a bit sparse. We'll see what the future brings and
          we'll meet it when it does. No need to worry about anything now, we'll
          take it one step at a time. I still find it quite amazing we have new
          updates at all! After all, SQ6 hit the shelves back in 1996/1997. If
          somebody told me in advance that I would still be updating in 2005,
          I would have called them crazy.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before
          I start listing today's update, I'd like to announce <a href="http://www.eperfect.net" target="_blank">Eperfect.net</a>,
          our generous sponsor, has donated an extra 60 Gigabytes of bandwidth
          to <img src="extraimages/sqnet.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="87" height="11">,
          free of charge! This means the website is adequately equiped to house
          around 20,000 unique visitors each month (we're getting over 11,000
          right now). This also means downloading the games will be available
          a bit longer. The games.spacequest.net account has been extended by
          30 gigabytes, making up a total of a mind boggling 200 gygabytes of
          extremely high quality bandwidth!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
          was able to update <img src="extraimages/sqnet.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="87" height="11"> today
          thanks to a great number of contributions. A special thanks to the
          members of the <a href="http://forum.spacequest.net"> Janitorial Times</a>!
          The following pages have been updated today:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="misc/customsqpc/index.shtml">The
            custom sq computer article</a> contains a new, rather short, explanation
            about which soundcards produce the best results for use with the
            Space Quest Series. No biggie, but it's a must read if you're interested
            in building your own vintage gaming computer specifically build for
            Space Quest. Finally, I've added some additional VGA screen shots
            to the <a href="sq1/screenshots/index.shtml">Space Quest 1 Screenshot
            page</a>. Thanks to Space Quest fan &quot;RDSF&quot;. I've added
            a new contribution to the &quot;<a href="sq3/cancelled/index.shtml">Cancelled
            Stuff</a>&quot; section of Space Quest 3. It's a about three new
            death messages. The Space Quest 4 &quot;<a href="sq4/spoofref/index.shtml">Spoof
            and Reference</a>&quot; page has been updated with three new additions.
            Then we have two new additions to the <a href="sq1/funfacts/index.shtml">Space
            Quest 1 Funfacts</a> page and one new <a href="sq5/spoofref/index.shtml">Space
            Quest 5 Spoof and Reference</a>. New contributions are accompanied
            with a &quot;NEW&quot; image for easy reference. I've added one great
            new image to <a href="misc/fanfiction/index.shtml">the fanfiction
            section</a>. It was made by Akril. Lastly, Space Quest fan &quot;New
            Rising Sun&quot; who brought us the excellent patches for the nasty <a href="misc/timerissues/index.shtml">timer
            issues</a> has released an update for the Space Quest 4 CD-Rom version.
            This is what he has to say:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Against
          my better judgment, I am hereby releasing an update to the CD-ROM version
          of Space Quest IV. This update changes the game into the state it should
          have been, in my opinion, in 1994. Changes include: <br>
        - superior graphics, taken from the floppy version <br>
        - ability to hear speech and read text at the same time <br>
        - correct timing <br>
        - various bug fixes <br>
        The windows interpreter &quot;SCIWV&quot; is neither included nor supported.
        Don't use previous saved games. The version number has been changed from
        1.0 to 1.1.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Installation
          instructions:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With
          the replacement of nearly every single graphics resource, the usual &quot;patch&quot; distribution
          method is inadequate; instead, the full game, minus the audio file,
          is included. Extract the .zip archive into an empty directory. Open
          the RESOURCE.CFG file with a text editor and change the path specification
          after &quot;audio =&quot; to the CD-ROM or hard disk directory where
          the RESOURCE.AUD file resides.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's
          a discussion at the Janitorial Times about this new update. Please <a href="http://forum.spacequest.net/viewtopic.php?p=9661">click
