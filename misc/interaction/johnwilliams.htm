  interview with John Williams</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To give you 
  some more background information regarding John Williams, I've posted the following 
  interview, which originally appeared on the <a href="http://www.backspin.org/kensentme/index.html" target="_blank">Ken 
  Sent Me website</a>. Click on the link for the complete interview. The entire 
  interview has two interesting questions for <img src="../../extraimages/sqnet.gif" width="87" height="11" alt="SpaceQuest.Net"> 
  readers:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who are you, and what 
  do you do, at Sierra?<br>
  </b>I'm John Williams and I run Sierra's Magazine which is called InterAction. 
  InterAction is published 4 times each year and has a circulation of just a little 
  less than one million per issue. If you buy and register your Sierra games, 
  you should get InterAction. I've worked at Sierra for 17 years now. (I'm employee 
  number 001.) Sierra founder Ken Williams is my brother. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How is a typical day 
  of working at Sierra?<br>
  </b>Sierra is hectic. The company moves fast. If you show up here on Saturday 
  you'll find the office is full of people just like any other day, and even on 
  Sunday there are lots of people here when I come in after church. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sierra is an interesting 
  place to work because everyone here is highly creative - even the traditionally 
  boring people like the accountants have a unique style to them. When you travel 
  around to the various Sierra offices (and they are all over the United States 
  and Europe now) it's not uncommon to see Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, etc. displayed 
  in peoples offices. Other places, people have decorated their offices with the 
  tires from Indy racecars or built highly intricate art studios for themselves. 
  Interestingly enough, it seems like the MOST creative people are actually the 
  ones with the least elaborate offices. Roberta, for instance, works in a little 
  8x8&quot; office when she works at the office, and at home she has a simple 
  desk next to her bed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At Sierra, we constantly 
  argue and fight with each other but I mean that in a good way. We argue about 
  what's fun, what makes for the best box and what customers want. No one around 
  here doesn't have a strong opinion - we don't have those kind of people here. 
  It's a battle of wits and we all appreciate it. Our goal is to make sure that 
  the best ideas get built into the product, and sometimes that means there's 
  a bruised ego around the place, but it doesn't last long. Ultimately, it's exciting 
  to be part of the process even when you're working on someone else's good idea.</font></p>
