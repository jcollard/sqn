<p>[4.8] Space Quest in other games<br>
  ---------------------------------- </p>
<p>Throughout certain other Sierra games, Roger has made a small guest appearance, 
  or something from the SQ-series has been given a mention. Here's a list of the 
  currently known SQ-cameos in other games: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.1] Leisure Suit Larry III <br>
  -------------------------------- </p>
<p>Roger Wilco has a cameo appearance in LSL3, in the bar inside the casino (where 
  Passionate Patti plays the piano). He will sometimes appear on a bar stool, 
  drinking away. Elvis also appears on a different stool. It's randomly chosen, 
  when or when not he will show up. Just walk into the bar and out again, then 
  in and out again until he shows up. Not only that, but during the ending sequence, 
  you wind up in the set for Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge. Also, during the 
  ending sequence, there's the genetically engineered salesmen from SQ2 and the 
  Monolith Burger-sign from SQ3 on the prop-screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.2] King's Quest II<br>
  ------------------------- </p>
<p>After you've been on the magic carpet ride, there's a big rock. Look into the 
  hole and you'll see a plug for Space Quest I. (Submitted by Matan Kalman) The 
  reason is, that both Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe worked on King's Quest II. 
  Scott Murphy adds to the explanation: &quot;I was doing an EGA AGI conversion 
  of King's Quest 2. Ken Williams was actually the one to suggest that I slip 
  in a mention of Space Quest. I thought of a way that I thought was relatively 
  unobtrusive and not automatic, and put it in a small hole in a rock. In work 
  on a re-release of KQ2 it was reported that Roberta Williams (the designer) 
  found out about it and didn't like it and had it extracted from the game. I 
  think most of them sold had the SQ plug, however.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.3] Jones in the Fast Lane <br>
  -------------------------------- </p>
<p>The burger bar in this game is called &quot;Monolith Burger&quot;. You can 
  also order an &quot;Astro Chicken&quot; there. The reason could be because of 
  Josh Mandel's input in this game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> [4.8.4] Quest for Glory I / Hero's Quest I <br>
  -------------------------------------------- <br>
  Go to the Guild Master inside the Guild Hall and ask him about Antwerps. He 
  will tell you that &quot;two strange tourists&quot; almost made the Antwerps 
  extinct. These two strange tourists are, yes you guessed it, the Two Guys from 
  Andromeda. (Thanks to Tovi Almozlino for first reporting it, Fred Zanfardino 
  for additional information, and Matias Jakobsen for showing me.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.5] Police Quest I <br>
  ------------------------ <br>
  In this game, a fellow called the &quot;Gremlin&quot; is angry with the boss, 
  and in once instant, ties a chicken to his desk. When you enter the room and 
  see the chicken on his desk, the theme from Astrochicken is played. (Submitted 
  by Leo Kramer, Fred Zanfardino and Matan Kalman) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.6] Police Quest IV: Open Season<br>
  -------------------------------------- <br>
  When trying to use the computer in Luella Parker's office, the game responds 
  that you don't have time to play Space Quest V: The Final Frontier. (Submitted 
  by Domen Novak) Some people have been having troubles getting this to work, 
  for any odd reason. The trouble is, they click it on the closeup of the desk. 
  You're supposed to click the screen of the computer when the entire room is 
  displayed. (Also submitted by Domen Novak) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.7] King's Quest IV <br>
  ------------------------- <br>
  When Rosella breaks into the witch's castle to get the chicken that lays golden 
  eggs back, the music from Astrochicken is played. (Submitted by Matan Kalman) 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.8] Leisure Suit Larry I EGA<br>
  ---------------------------------- <br>
  When dying and being transported underground to be &quot;rebuild&quot;, there 
  are a lot of characters from other Sierra games down there. One of them is Roger's 
  navigation droid from Space Quest I. (Submitted by Matan Kalman) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.9] Quest for Glory II<br>
  ---------------------------- <br>
  When you ask the astrologer about the model, he'll tell you that it shows the 
  relations between stars called &quot;Xenon&quot;, &quot;Ortega&quot;, &quot;Phleebhut&quot;, 
  etc. Naturally, the aforementioned celestrial bodies have all starred in Space 
  Quest games. (Submitted by Matan Kalman) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.10] Take a Break! Pinball <br>
  -------------------------------- <br>
  Released in April, 1992. Developed by Dynamix, published by Sierra (duh). Avaliable 
  for IBM PC and compatibles running Windows 3.1(+) only. Two of the eight tables 
  included were named &quot;Planet Pinball&quot;, which featured Roger Wilco in 
  the Space Quest 4 setting. The first table's artwork features a Xenon background 
  from Vohaul's Revenge II (with lanes entitled &quot;Rope Me&quot;, &quot;Energize!&quot; 
  and &quot;Shoot the Sewer&quot;). The second one is a Galaxy Galleria table. 
  (Submitted by Theodore Reiker) Also, Roger looks like a distorted Manga character. 
  Blasphemy! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.11] Leisure Suit Larry I VGA (Russian version) <br>
  ----------------------------------------------------- <br>
  The Russian translation of Larry I was done by the same people that also translated 
  SQ4 and SQ5 into Russian. In the bathroom, a graffiti on the wall reads &quot;Dr. 
  Vohaul is a bastard! R. Wilco&quot;. This only appears in the Russian version 
  of the game. (Submitted by Vsevolod S. Alexeev) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.12] Leisure Suit Larry II<br>
  -------------------------------- <br>
  When you're in Los Angeles in the beginning of the game, one of the screens 
  depict a number of shining office blocks and a couple of hedges in the front. 
  (South of the expensive dress shoppe.) If you type &quot;look&quot;, you'll 
  be told that &quot;this place looks like it belongs in Space Quest IV, The Coarsegold 
  Encounter&quot;. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.13] Conquests of the Longbow<br>
  ----------------------------------- <br>
  If you go into the control panel and hit the Sierra-button, the game will give 
  you the credits, then inform you that &quot;no guys from Andromeda&quot; partook 
  in the creation of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4.8.14] Quest for Glory II - Trial By Fire <br>
  --------------------------------------------- <br>
  In keapon Laffin's magic shop, there's a collection of Orats-on-a-Stick lining 
  the wall. When you look at them, the game says, &quot;You'll have to agree these 
  are quite clearly 'Orats-on-a-Stick'. Quite useful. Somewhere.&quot; (Submitted
