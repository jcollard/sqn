              1997 Sierra decided to make another Space Quest. The decision was 
              based upon the relatively successful Space Quest 6 (which was released 
              a while back in March 1995) and upon the feedback Sierra was getting 
              from fans all around the planet who demanded to see another Roger 
              Wilco space adventure. Whatever you might have heard about Space 
              Quest 6 sales figures, the game <em>was</em> a success. It sold 
              <em>a lot</em> more copies than Space Quest 5 did. However, it had 
              cost around 5 times more and unfortunately (I'm sure you saw this 
              one coming), it didn't sell 5 times as much. This known fact would 
              later be an argument for the marketing guys to scrap the project.</font></p>

              included in the upcoming Space Quest Collection CD-Rom. Since the 
              project is still so young, not much has been decided regarding story 
              line, interface, etc. The team will be trying to introduce a multiplayer 
              aspect to SQ7, as well as a single-player mode. It remains to be 
              decided whether they want to go for the RPG-style multiplayer, or 
              a hybrid. According to Scott Murphy Space Quest 7 will contain some 
              3-D elements. However, these elements will NOT require the use of 
              a 3D accelerator card and the game should retain its standard 2-D

              <font color="#CC0000"> How did you get involved with Sierra? </font><br>
              Way back in the Apple II days, I was into playing various games 
              that guys at college had obtained (ok, they were pirated). Among 
              the games were Wizard &amp; the Princess (from Sierra of course). 
              Since then, I followed what Sierra was doing in the industry even 
              though I was a big Commodore 64 and Amiga guy. I thought the Amiga 
              kicked the PC's butt in every way, but corporate America didn't 
              care about that. Since my job required it, I began using PC's, and 
              about the same time, Sierra released King's Quest 5 and Space Quest 
              4 with 256 color art. Once I saw how beautiful the graphics were, 
              I was convinced that the PC was going to be a viable gaming platform, 
              so I started honing my skills in C++, and then Windows, hoping perhaps 
              that one day I could get into the industry. Just over 2 1/2 years 
              ago, I answered an ad in Sierra's Interaction magazine, because 
              I thought there may finally be a match between my skills and what 
              Sierra was looking for. Sierra thought so too, and I left my previous 
              job of 10 years to start all over again in the R&amp;D group in 
              Oakhurst, CA.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#CC0000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
              other projects have you worked on at Sierra?</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              <br>
              When I first got to Sierra, I worked in R&amp;D, and we were responsible 
              for SCI interpreter that all the adventure games were being done 
              in. Among the more notable games that were released while I was 
              in R&amp;D included Phantasmagoria, Gabriel Knight 2, Rama, Shivers 
              and Lighthouse. I also did some specific engine work that was used 
              in Shivers 2 and Betrayal in Antara. Sierra in Oakhurst made a decision 
              to go away from SCI, and as part of the change, many of the guys 
              in R&amp;D moved on to be lead programmers on various games. I became 
              the lead on the Colliers Encyclopedia product. I really wanted to 
              get on a game though, so about half way through when there was a 
              replacement for me, I moved to do engine work for Swat 2. Once I'm 
              released from Swat 2, I will be full time on SQ7. The good news 
              is that much of the work I'm doing on Swat 2 will be used on Space 
              Quest 7, so it is not as if Space Quest 7 is not making any progress.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#CC0000">How 
              is the SQ7 project going? </font><br>
              Not as fast as we'd like on the programming side since my current 
              project, Swat 2, has yet to ship. We are trying to get our approval 
              prototype up and ready for early December. The design and artwork 
              is proceeding however, and our art staff is set to ramp up next 
              week.</font></p>

              much of the programming is done on SQ7?</font><br>
              Our biggest focus at this time on Space Quest 7 is getting it through 
              prototype approval. This means that we will build a small playable 
              portion of the game for Ken Williams and the other executives to 
              approve. Our current push is to ship SWAT 2 and Quest for Glory 
              5, and every resource has been focused on those two products. In 
              the short run that postpones Space Quest 7 development, but in the 
              long run we will have the same advantage as Quest for Glory and 
              SWAT, because we'll be able to demand resources when we're at the 
              critical point in Space Quest's development.</font></p>

              How the production of Space Quest 7 is what? Come on now, Neil. 
              Only I can type that way. You're the serious journalist. I'm the 
              eccentric artist-type and I can get away with more. Space Quest 
              7 is coming along. We're in the very early stages of development. 
              We're just getting some artists. We hope to have a programmer or 
              two in the not too distant future. We've been involved lately in 
              producing an AVI for the new Space Quest Collection, which will 
              include Space Quest 1-6 as well as some other little ditties for 
              your amusement. </font></p>

              first inspired you to be a game programmer?</font><br>
              The mere joy of making things happen on the screen. My first programming 
              was in AppleSoft Basic. About a year or two later I got exposed 
              to the programming part of the business. I got my first real taste 
              doing The Black Cauldron for Disney. I loved it! (The fifteen hour 
              days sucked but you've got to do these things in this business. 
              I was learning a lot from Ken Williams. It came so easy to Ken and 
              he understood it so well that for me, learning from him was like 
              drinking from a fire hose. Al Lowe was there to, now that I think 
              of it, but he just spent a lot of time pitifully shaking parts of 
              his anatomy while smiling, and peeling the paint off the walls in 
              his own special way. (Hi, Al.) </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#CC0000">What 
              first inspired you to create Space Quest?</font><br>
              Well, since I'd gotten well into the company I wanted to do a space 
              game. While working on The Black Cauldron, I got hooked up working 
              with Mark Crowe who was doing graphics. We spent a lot of late nights 
              working at Ken's house. We found out we had very similiar senses 
              of humor and interests in sci-fi. We also liked to laugh. We talked 
              off and on about how a space game could be approached and how to 
              get approval to make it. We decided people needed to laugh. All 
              the &quot;heroes&quot; in games then were all way too noble prince 
              types. Very boring! We wanted a hero for the rest of the world. 
              Thus was born Roger Wilco, a normal (or less) person in extraordinary 
              circumstances. A path of least resistance kind of guy. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#CC0000">Have 
              you ever had an encounter with an UFO from space?</font><br>
              I'm not sure. Around here I've seen some UWO's, unidentified walking 
              objects, and some USO's, unidentified sitting objects. They seem 
              to be spread equally between artists, programmers, and especially 
              management. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#CC0000">About 
              how much does a programmer like you get payed a year?</font><br>
              Get payed? They told me this was a priviledge and that I have to 
              pay. I think I need to have a talk with somebody! </font></p>

              is &quot;multiplayer&quot; going to be used in Space Quest 7?</font><br>
              It will be used so that more than one person can play in a Space 
              Quest game session. Actually, I can't tell you that at this time 
              because it's a story secret. Trust me, it'll be interesting. </font></p>

              He also has some personal demons to deal with. Boy, does he. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#CC0000">How 
              challenging are you trying to make Space Quest 7?</font><br>
              Well, harder than a three year old finishing it off in 90 minutes 
              and easier than a 25 year not being able to finish it within 500 
              hours. Actually we try to appeal to everyone, which is difficult. 
              We want players to see all we've dreamed up for them, but not inside 
              a few hours. We want the vast majority to feel the toughness of 
              play is just right. </font></p>

              I am invoking the fifth amendment of the constitution of the United 
              States so that I may not incriminate myself. I spend a lot of time 
              contemplating creative methods of suicide. Between those thoughts, 
              I try to work on the design of the game while listening to haughty 
              whining co-designers (Leslie Balfour), and prissy artists (Rich 
              Powell), as well as Project Managers who act like they own you.

              being unstable, egocentric, or difficult to work with. That's such 
              crap and these pea brains should be smart enough to understand that.

              late december, 1997. The reason why was given in this e-mail fans 
              from all around the globe received. It was written by Scott Murphy 
              and Leslie Balfour:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
              the Friends and Fans of Space Quest,</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              As you all know, the path to Space Quest 7 has been long and bumpy, 
              and we were never sure what we would find at the end of the road. 
              The decision has been made, after much soul-searching and agonizing, 
              to put Space Quest 7 on hold indefinitely. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              joy for the team has been in the journey. We've made many friends 
              out there, and it has been quite heartening to know that Roger Wilco 
              has so many fans. I look forward to continuing the friendships I've 
              developed over the last year. But Sierra is in the process of many 
              changes, and we had to take a hard look at whether a Space Quest 
              7 project made sense. Unfortunately for those of us who love Roger 
              and his stupid antics, other projects just have more to offer both 
              to the company and to our customers in general at this time.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please 
              don't worry about the team. We will all move to other projects at 
              Sierra On-Line. Many of us will go over to the Babylon 5 space combat 
              game, which will be coming out in Holiday 1998. Others will go over 
              to the B5 adventure game, which will also come out in 1999. Both 
              of these products will reflect Sierra's commitment to excellence 
              in space games, and I hope you'll consider playing them if you have 
              the opportunity.</font></p>

              Please pass the information on to any Space Quest fans I inadvertently 
              omitted.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
              don't be sad for Roger. Just think of him as weary from making us 
              laugh for all these years, ready for a break from his adventures. 
              He and la Wankmeister want to settle down, raise a family. And perhaps 
              as we look up in the sky, a distant star will remind us that somewhere, 
              in a distant galaxy, Roger Wilco is probably getting pantsed.</font></p>

              Then on February the 22th, 1999 (which is called 'Chainsaw Monday' 
              by Scott Murphy) Space Quest 7 was finally axed. Sierra closed down 
              its Oakhurst California facility, firing two-third of the employees 
              there. Scott Murphy, who was an old timer at Sierra, also had to 
              pack his bags as his contract had expired and was not renewed. The 
              rest of the employees has been given an opportunity to relocate 
              to other Sierra divisions like Belvue Washington. The Oakhurst facility 
              was the roots of Sierra. It produced games like Leisure Suit Larry, 
              King's Quest, Quest for Glory and of course Space Quest. This action 
              of corporate consolidation was taken by the new owner, Havas, which 
              bought Sierra from CUC Software. The following letter was written

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Roberta and I wish to express our deepest sympathies for the recent 
              loss of your jobs. Hopefully, it will not be long before you resume 
              work at Sierra in Seattle, or at some other company... in Oakhurst, 
              or elsewhere. According to tradition, I'm supposed to say something 
              uplifting and motivational to help everyone feel better. Unfortunately, 
              I have failed at this task. There is really nothing good that can 
              be said. This is a sad ending to Sierra's twenty-year operating 
              history in Oakhurst, which at one time, represented over 550 Oakhurst-based 
              employees. This story should have had a happy ending, but instead 
              has had a long string of bad news concluding with the shutdown yesterday 
              of all of Sierra's Oakhurst-based product development activities.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              problems began with the move of corporate to Seattle. The move to 
              Seattle was mandated for several reasons, primarily due to the difficulty 
              we were having recruiting senior management staff and software engineers. 
              The relocation, although it was painful for Oakhurst, was instrumental 
              in our tremendous growth from 1993 through 1996. I remain convinced 
              that this relocation was the right decision for Sierra, and that 
              we would not have prospered without it.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              I can't say the same about either the sale of The ImagiNation Network 
              (INN) in 1993, or the sale of Sierra itself in 1996. When Sierra 
              started INN in 1991, it was a decade ahead of its time. After investing 
              millions in INN, Sierra found that it did not have the financial 
              resources to support INN's continued operations. In 1993, AT&amp;T 
              sought aggressively to acquire INN, promising to market the service 
              and grow the company. Unfortunately, AT&amp;T lost interest in INN 
              and sold it to AOL, who to my great disappointment, shut INN down. 
              </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sierra, 
              as you know, was purchased by CUC International in 1996. Because 
              CUC was offering to buy the company at a price roughly 90% higher 
              than it was trading, the decision was out of management's hands. 
              At the time of the purchase, we did believe that through consolidation 
              with several Sierra competitors (Blizzard, Knowledge Adventure, 
              Davidson and others), Sierra would become a much stronger company. 
              We had good reason to believe that the acquisition would cause us 
              to grow faster, not shrink. Unfortunately, CUC elected to transfer 
              control of the company to Davidson, and shut down several groups 
              at Sierra. Later, as we all know, CUC was merged with another company, 
              HFS, to form the Cendant corporation, with roughly 12,000 employees. 
              A few months after this merger it was discovered that someone, or 
              possibly some group of people, within the former CUC organization 
              had been fraudulently preparing financial statements. The actions 
              of this handful of people, who shall hopefully get their due, caused 
              the plunge in Cendant's stock price, and wiped out the net worth 
              of many HFS and CUC employees, including many of you, as well as 
              much of my own. Cendant was sued by its shareholders, CUC's former 
              management team was terminated and the decision was made to sell 
              the software business. It should surprise no one that morale suffered 
              through all of this anarchy, and although I have not seen Sierra's 
              financials for several years, my assumption is that the recent consolidation 
              of operations is driven by a quest for restored profitability and 
              stability. If this story were written as a book, the publisher might 
              seek to classify it as &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction&quot; 
              or even &quot;Horror&quot;. It is much too outrageous to be true. 
              But the bad news is that these events really did happen.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              I console myself in the following way, and perhaps it will help 
              you to cope with what has occurred. Let's imagine that a stranger 
              had walked up to any of us, on the street, in 1979, and said: &quot;Would 
              you like to move to one of the greatest cities on earth? While you 
              are there, you can play a key role in creating a company that just 
              about everyone will know and respect. Your grandchildren will be 
              amazed when they learn that you once worked there. You will be the 
              envy of your peers, because they will know that your team created 
              the largest collection of hits ever to come from one company. There 
              will even be years when you will have played a role in over half 
              the products on the industries top ten lists! You will be surrounded 
              by incredibly intelligent, hard working people, who will work 20+ 
              hours per day when it takes it to get the job done. And, you will 
              have more fun than you ever thought possible. There's only one catch 
              though. This will only last for twenty years.&quot; Even knowing 
              it wouldn't last forever I would have followed that stranger anywhere. 
              I'm disappointed that it didn't last forever, but, a 20 year ride 
              on the greatest roller coaster on earth beats the heck out of life 
              in the slow lane any day. Life may never be the same, but it also 
              isn't over, and we all have some great memories we shall never forget. 
              Good luck, and I miss you all.</font></p>
