            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both 
              released by Osborne McGraw-Hill, the Space Quest Companion is written 
              by Peter Spear and his son Jeremy Spear. Peter Spear is known throughout 
              the Sierra Universe for his Sierra-authorized hintbooks, like the 
              Police Quest Casebook, King's Quest Companion and of course The 
              Space Quest Companion. The Space Quest Companion is the most wanted 
              Space Quest book out there. Much harder to find than &quot;the Official 
              Guide to Roger Wilco's Space Adventures&quot;, I might add. The 
              book starts with an introduction of the writers and &quot;a read 
              me first&quot;. A very weird story, indeed. The book continues with 
              &quot;The 12 Spear Rules for Playing Computer Games (version 2.0)&quot;, 
              helpful hints how to play your Space Quest adventure. Great and 
              helpful for the beginner, and also useful for the die-hard adventurer, 
              as time-waster&#153;. The book continues with &quot;A Message From 
              Beyond Space and Time&quot;, written by our beloved Roger Wilco 
              himself. The following part is right from the book:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Here's 
              a big, big hello from the future. Your future. And while a lot of 
              the future is already my past, a lot of my past is still my future. 
              And I'd like to keep it that way. Time travel can sometimes be so 
              confusing, especially when you really don't know what you're doing. 
              There is an old saying, ancient beyond galactic reckoning, that 
              asserts that some beings strive to attain greatness, while other 
              have greatness thrust upon them. I'm Roger Wilco, Space Ranger, 
              hero of Xenon, rescuer of the galaxy, savior of the universe - and 
              probably all of Time and Space as we know it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amen! 
              Our great friend continues giving a small insight of his adventures 
              (Space Quest 1 to 4). And after that, the book really starts with 
              what it's designed to do. Giving hints as a hintbook. But I don't 
              think this book is a mere hintbook. All four Space Quest sections 
              starts with the famous &quot;Roger Wilco On-Shift Nap Day Dream&quot;, 
              in which Roger dreams of greatness, Introductory from the real Space 
              Quest stories. The stories are written in first person, (we read 
              what Roger tells us). It will become clear why this book is the 
              most popular Space Quest book out there. The jokes are great, in 
              the famous &quot;Two Guys Style&quot;. The stories give great new 
              insights of Roger's life. You might want to strap yourself to your 
              chair before reading, as you'll fall from it, laughing. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
              the story, you'll find a &quot;Cruising Through Space Quest&quot; 
              part, which is of course the walkthrough chapter. This time illustrated 
              with screenshots. I must say the walkthroughs aren't the best I've 
              seen, but they certainly are complete and acquired. In the chapter 
              &quot;Keeping your Bearings in Space Quest&quot;, you'll find high 
              quality maps, although I found the Space Quest 2 maze somewhat hard 
              to understand, but that could be me. Each Space Quest chapter is 
              followed with &quot;Point of Interest in Space Quest&quot;; complete 
              pointlists for your Space Quest game.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Second Edition also covers Space Quest 5. The second edition's overall 
              printing quality has greatly improved.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
              are the downsides of these two books? Well, just like most Space 
              Quest books out there, you'll find no cheats and secrets. For $19.95 
              per book, the quality of the binding is poor (the pages are glued 
              together rather cheaply, like a paperback). My guess is that these 
              books won't last 2 years if they are used Intensively. Be sure to 
              handle them with extreme care. That is, if you don't want to have 
              pages falling out from everywhere and stuff like that. Both books 
              are almost impossible to find these days. Found a copy? Seize it!</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
              are two versions of this book. The first version covers Space Quest 
              1 to 4 and the second version Space Quest 1 to 5. It's a novel in 
              Roger's own words and it also includes walkthroughs, maps and screenshots 
              for all the games. The book starts with a great interview with everybody's 
              favorite anti-hero, Roger Wilco. The Roger in the book really looks 
              like the Roger we all know from our computer screens. He talks the 
              same and acts the same. Most importantly, he thinks the same. The 
              book let us see Roger's life from a different view. You'll read 
              the thoughts of Roger while he goes through his adventures. The 
              writers introduce Gladys, Roger's crush. She works as a communications 
              officer at Xenon Orbital Station 4 and it seems that Roger just 
              can't forget about her as she is constantly on Roger's mind...</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              &quot;Hi, there, Gladys? I don't believe we've actually met before, 
              but I've seen you around a lot. I'm Roger Wilco. You, uh, may have 
              heard of me... Well, don't be shy now.... Uh, well, I guess you 
              are shy. Okay, uh, I was wondering if you would be interested in 
              going out to dinner with me. I thought we could go over to the Monolith 
              Burger and.... uh .... Gladys? Ahem. Well, I'll definitely take 
              that as a no. Okay, well, see you later. Maybe some other time, 
              huh? I'll check back with you when you're not so busy... I have 
              to get back to work now. See you later... </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Holy 
              cow, I just made a fool of myself! That girl didn't even look up 
              from her post!&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Good 
              thinking, Roger! It is a very original concept by telling us know 
              how Roger thinks in his adventures. There is a great BUT, though. 
              Reading this book for too long at a time gets boring. There aren't 
              many conversations. And because you only read Roger's thoughts, 
              it's pretty monotonous. (we all new Roger is really an empty headed 
              human piece of waste, didn't we?). Just to demonstrate what I mean 
              with &quot;there aren't many conversations&quot;, read the encounter 
              of Roger and Arnoid the Annihilator:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Ahhhhh! Wh-at's go-ing on?... Haaaalp! Some-bod-y.... help... me.... 
              ahhhh.... (cough cough) .... uhhhh (gasp)... ahhhggg.... I h-hea 
              y-you!... Y-you're ch-oking me-e... (cough cough) Whew! I don't 
              believe it! I knew he looked familiar! That was Arnoid the Annihilator, 
              and he IS after me! Vending machine fraud! I never cheated any vending 
              machine - well, maybe just a little bit , that one in Ulence Flats 
              - but still, is that a reason to annihilate a person? He's the guy 
              I saw in the spaceship - the one who flashed by on the way to this 
              planet. That jerk followed me here. He's been looking for me... 
              (gulp).. the entire time!</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              style of &quot;Some-bod-y.... help... me.... ahhhh.... (cough cough) 
              .... uhhhh (gasp)... ahhhggg....&quot; etc, is found throughout 
              the book, which gets old rather quickly. Besides the novel/walkthrough 
              style stories, this book has maps and screen shots. The maps are 
              acquired and complete. I personally love the maps for the subfloor 
              tunnel system in the Goliath (Space Quest 5). No more wandering 
              around! Too bad that the quality of the screen shots are very poor.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
              think the writers did everything to make sure that their story matches 
              the game's. But they made some huge mistakes. I'll start with an 
              common mistake in the Space Quest Universe. The planet &quot;Phleebhut&quot; 
              is not spelled &quot;Pleebhut&quot;, nor &quot;Plheebhut&quot;! 
              They call Fester Blatz &quot;Festus&quot;. That sounds like some 
              kind of disease! Also, they tell us that the glowing gem was from 
              Kerona. But any hard-core Space Quester knows that the glowing gem 
              came from Labion. Flo have had 4 husbands, but I recall her having 
              14 or so. How could they made such a big mistakes?</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just 
              like any other Space Quest book, this is a collectors item. But 
              I don't think this is a good Space Quest book.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              is the official hint book for Space Quest 6 (duh!), authorized by 
              Sierra. This is the most complete walkthrough you'll ever find. 
              It starts with explaining how to install the game, which system 
              requirements you'll need to play the game, and other technical stuff. 
              Next is a chapter that tells us what Space Quest is all about. A 
              small summary for the new Space Questers, so to speak. This includes 
              words of Scott Murphy (one of the creators of Space Quest 6):</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              &quot;He's a guy without an agenda. He wishes that he could be a 
              superhero. Roger will always do the right thing when the situation 
              demands - even though he would rather be back in his quarters taking 
              a nap.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
              character database is also included. I think this database reveals 
              too much of the game, so it would be wise to skip it until you've 
              finished the game. Because it's inserted at the beginning of the 
              walkthrough, people might read stuff they don't want to know yet! 
              The book has several great looking maps, that will certainly be 
              of help, especially the Stellar body maps. You'll also find an enormous 
              amount of screenshots of possibly EVERY screen and of course pointlists. 
              The quality of the screenshots are not extremely good. It looks 
              like the printer could have used more ink; the screenshots are missing 
              contrast. But they aren't nearly as poor as the screenshots seen 
              in &quot;The Official Guide to Roger Wilco's Space Adventures&quot;. 
              The writer, John Sauer, has picked out several special objects or 
              screens throughout his book and put them into a special column which 
              I would like to call &quot;Zoom-Ins&quot;. He will tell or explain 
              about it in extreme detail.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              best part of this book is &quot;The Making of Space Quest 6&quot;, 
              which includes very cool <a href="../../sq6/sketches/index.shtml">design 
              sketches</a>. This book scores a big A+. It could use cheats and 
              secrets, but I've noticed that almost no hint books have this. If 
              you need a guide for Space Quest 6 than this is the one. And of 
              course, this is a great collector's item. I actually got it with 
              one of my Space Quest 6 copies I bought at <a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">Ebay</a>. 
              It shouldn't be to difficult to find this book.</font></p>

              precious Sierra items. This book was also my first online purchase, 
              but who cares? The book is divided into three chapters: &quot;True 
              Hackers&quot;, &quot;Hardware Hackers&quot; and the part that we're 
              interested in, &quot;Game Hackers&quot;. This last chapter (a whopping 
              130 pages) is about our favorite company, Sierra Entertainment (once 
              known as Sierra On-Line and On-Line Systems). It describes the early 
              days (1979 - 1983) of Sierra Entertainment in full detail. It features 
              well written &quot;mini-biographies&quot; of many people at Sierra. 
              To name a few: Ken &quot;more money, less problems&quot; Williams,

              to the dawn of Sierra, before the time of Mark Crowe and his social 
              unstable friend Scott Murphy. And yes, it is also before the time 
              of King's Quest and Space Quest, and even the whole Adventure Game 
              Interpreter (AGI) thing. You'll learn interesting things about AGI 
              at the end of the chapter, though. Find out that Sierra's the road 
              to greatness was far from easy: management problems, multi-million 
              law suits, defecting programmers, missing floppy's (no, we are not 
              talking about LSL4 here) and much more. Find a huge amount of information 
              concerning old games like &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot;, &quot;Mystery 
              House&quot;, &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; and much more oldies.</font></p>

              You should really try this one out, that's all I can say. Get this 
              book at Amazon now, start reading it, and you won't even stop for 
              dinner (nor road-crossing children). Just read it! Every die-hard 
              fan should have at least one copy (If you have more than one, give 
              it away to a fellow fan). Did you know Ken Williams had a racquetball

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Die 
              Space Quest Story&quot; is probably not very famous in the Space 
              Quest Universe, mainly because it's a German book. From what I know, 
              the only place where this book is mentioned is in the Space Quest 
              FAQ. That's too bad because it's an extremely well done hint book. 
              That having said, it was pretty popular in the old days, possibly 
              being the &quot;ultimate guide&quot; for German Sierra fans. And 
              we did had a LOT of those, let me tell you.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              first impression of the book is a good one. A non-Sierra-made art 
              work immediately springs out. The cover material kinda reminds me 
              of a snake skin. Though the Dutch version doesn't have the snake 
              look and feel (nor the cool art work), it has some neat looking 
              foil stamping on the cover (an effect you can't see from the scan 
              I'm afraid). I'll be reviewing version 1-3, but 1-4 is pretty much 
              the same. An interesting side note: the ISBN number of both editions 
              are the same because 1-4 followed up 1-3.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              book starts with explaining every function of the menu bar for all 
              three Space Quest games. I was surprised to find a complete cheat 
              list for Space Quest 1, which I've never seen in a SQ hint book 
              before! The book continues with an introduction by telling us which 
              words the parser can understand. These words are listed in the so 
              called &quot;Andromedan dictionary&quot;, which is pretty funny. 
              It explains simple words, helping the not-so-English fans among 
              us, but also some Space Quest specific things like &quot;Star Generator&quot; 
              and &quot;Glowing Gem&quot;. The dictionary also gives out some 
              global hints.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next 
              are the hints (walkthroughs actually), starting with the Space Quest 
              1 introductory story. The hints are written in third-person view. 
              Here's an excerpt from the book (loosely translated by yours truly):</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 
              road still is dangerous, so saving the game often is no luxury, 
              but luckily Roger can take the familiar obstacles a lot faster now. 
              He presents the proof of his successful mission to the strange alien.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              maps are acquired, but you really need to look at them closely before 
              understanding them with the exception of the Space Quest 2 tunnel 
              maze. This is the most acquired and most helpful Space Quest map 
              I've ever seen in my entire life. It beats the hell out the Official 
              Hint Book from Sierra AND the Space Quest Companion.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              book also contains various screenshots of decent quality to help 
              illustrate the walkthough. At the end of the book you'll find a 
              list of all the inventory/puzzle objects with information how to 
              find those, followed by a point list. But that's not all; it also 
              contains a chapter helping you installing the games on your computer. 
              You could say this book is a hint book <i>and</i> game manual!</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apparently 
              there's also a Dutch translation of the 1-3 version, called &quot;Het 
              Grote Space Quest Boek&quot;. I found it on some obscure Dutch auction 
              site for 5 bucks. Some guys really don't know what they are selling. 
              Die Space Quest Story is just one of the many &quot;Sierra hint 
              books&quot; published by Data Becker. I highly recommend any of 
              them to fellow German or Dutch Space Questers. That is, if you can 
              find one.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, 
              it's a full colour hintbook (which is unique) for Space Quest 5. 
              It features 106 pages, complete with screenshots of important sections 
              of the game. The book includes a complete game solution, background 
              information and so-called &quot;insider tips&quot;. The book begins 
              with the usual message from the author, background information on 
              Mark and Scott and a brief technical specification overview. The 
              first &quot;main chapter&quot; of the book is titled &quot;As Everything 
              Began&quot;. This is a brief rundown of the Space Quest story, which 
              discusses Space Quest 1 through 4, then ultimately on to 5. We are 
              firstly presented with &quot;The Arising Persons of Space Quest 
              5&quot;, with a brief introduction to the main characters of the 
              game: Roger Wilco, Captain Quirk, Flo, Droole, Cliff, Beatrice and 
              WD40. Then we go on to the SQ5 hints... After the hints for the 
              different parts of the game, there is a rundown on the different 
              inventory items found in the game, a shortened rundown of required 
              actions in the game (along with points value), a troubleshooting 
              section for certain puzzles and then lastly the maps for the SCS 
              GOLIATH.</font></p>

              is a very expansive Dutch hint book, published by the Sybex division 
              in the Netherlands. It covers Space Quest 1 to 5 but is different 
              from the hint book series published by Sybex Germany. The book is 
              divided into two parts both containing information about the games. 
              Part one is a hint section and part two offers walkthroughs.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
              took me about 5 minutes to make up my mind about this book. I'd 
              like to point out a few fine blunders. The author begins his inaccurate 
              and unconstructive rants by calling Space Quest 1 a CGA game. To 
              his opinion, the game is incredibly outdated. &quot;It's almost 
              unplayable when comparing it with a modern game. But luckily Sierra 
              re-release the game with VGA graphics&quot;. Unplayable? I'm sorry. 
              I didn't knew the best selling platinum awarded (over 250.000 copies 
              sold, HUGE amount for that time) game called Space Quest 1 suddenly 
              becomes unplayable because newer games happen to looks better. According 
              to our lovely writer, who I deeply respect, Space Quest 2 did show 
              some progress over Space Quest 1 technology-wise. The images, for 
              instance, are EGA instead of CGA. A completely idiotic statement 
              since both games are created using the same engine: AGI. The question 
              whether or not the author used a CGA or EGA version of the game 
              is complete irrelevant. AGI = AGI, which is based upon EGA, with 
              an optional CGA option if you don't have the equipment. The guy 
              should have had his facts straight before writing a book. The worst 
              part is yet to come. He deliriously rants on by telling us: &quot;Space 
              Quest 3 is about the same image quality as SQ2&quot;. I can only 
              feel Space Quest 3 has just been raped big time by some guy who 
              really don't know what he's talking about. &quot;This game features 
              (although very limited) music and soundeffects.&quot; ... Excuse 
              me? Very limited? Obviously, that's why the musical orchestra, created 
              by Bob Siebenburg, is the best and most loved of the Series! And 
              of course, we all know the manual supplied with SQ3 contains information 
              you MUST HAVE to play the game. Well sorry Wim, but that's not true. 
              SQ3 doesn't have copyright protection of any kind.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              the completely miss-put intro, he continues with a small article 
              about the humor featured in the Space Quest games, explaining them 
              in the same way the SQFAQ does. A pretty original idea, something 
              I've never seen in a Space Quest book. But once again, I couldn't 
              help to notice HUGE mistakes. According to Wim, our most beloved 
              author, SQ2 featured Monolith Burgers. A typo maybe? Unlikely story. 
              A little bit further on in his over-all SQ5-minded article, was 
              a statement that made my bone marrow cook: &quot;You can find some 
              information how SQ5 was created in the Galactic Inquirer. It shows 
              us how hard it is to come up with original idea's for a science 
              fiction game. The article features a photo of Scott Murphy and Mark 
              Crowe who are busy copying down the Star Trek Compendium&quot;. 
              Mommy, I see black sparks in front of eyes. Three strikes! You're 
              out pall!</font></p>

              finally arriving at the hint section we have some time to cool off. 
              The hints are pretty good and the quality of the screen shots is 
              pretty darn good. He was able to attract my attention by mentioning 
              Space Quest XXII - Attack of the Killer Cucumbers in his SQ4 hints. 
              I thought this guy had found a time pod code I didn't know about... 
              But what do you know?! It's an attempt to be humorous.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 
              to the book our writer Dieter M&uuml;ller is on Mars, living the 
              newest Space Quest adventure with Roger Wilco. Glad that's out of 
              the way. What captured my curiosity was the art on the cover of 
              the book. Very cool indeed. The books starts with a big warning 
              not to make copies of these great games. Something I appreciate 
              seeing in hint books as many gamers buy such books in hopes to find 
              copyright protection and other stuff you need to have to play the 
              games. Next is an intro about the Space Quest Saga which closes 
              with the invitation to meet at the Monolith Burger in Quadrant 4. 
              Those guys are everywhere, aren't they?! You'll also find an installation 
              guide and a chapter explaining the icons used in the solution chapter. 
              The thing that bothered my was the HUGE title bar on top of almost 
              every page, which takes up a good 1/5 of the entire page. There 
              aren't too many screen shots but who need those anyway? The solutions 
              are nicely complete. The usual point lists and maps are included 
              too.</font></p>
