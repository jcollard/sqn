              &quot;I didn't start out to make computer games my life's work. 
              It was an accident. I saw an adventure game before I worked here 
              (Sierra -ed), and I liked it. I had a job I hated and I kept bugging 
              Sierra until they let me come and work as a dealer returns person. 
              And I kept learning things. So I became a support representative 
              for games and then for business products, then I ended up managing 
              the support department.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
              the big crunch hit (in the mid-1980s Sierra On-Line weathered a 
              bankruptcy threat through a major reorganization -ed) and I started 
              doing QA (Quality Assurance) work as well as support stuff. As I 
              got closer to where they were creating the games, I saw Mark Crowe 
              and Doug MacNeill working on graphics for King's Quest 2 and Black 
              Cauldron, and I was intrigued. I started bugging Ken to let me try 
              a game. I saw people working on programming, and I knew that if 
              they could do it, I could do it. So I kept bugging Ken, and finally 
              he shut me up and let me try it. I put in a lot of free time over 
              his house debugging Black Cauldron. And then I ended up being the 
              only one working on it. After a while, Ken and Al Lowe bailed out 
              on me. So I got Black Cauldron shipping, and I was hooked.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scott 
              and Mark Crowe (the other guy behind the Space Quest Series) first 
              met eachother during work on &quot;the Black Cauldron&quot; game. 
              The two got together and decided to do a game of their own, in their 
              favorite genre - science fiction. But when they approached the big 
              cheese of Sierra (Ken Williams at that time) with the proposal to 
              do a humorous science fiction game, Ken told them no. A funny scifi 
              game just wouldn't sell, he said. But the Two Guys were determined 
              and in their spare time programmed what later became the first four 
              rooms the Sarien Encounter. Scott programmed, Mark did graphics 
              and Ken loved the demo and gave them green light to proceed. And 
              the rest, is history.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
              work on Space Quest 4 was completed, Scott Murphy left Space Quest 
              indefinately. Scott Murphy tells it this way: &quot;It wasn't so 
              much 'running out of ideas' as it was that we (Scott and Mark -ed) 
              needed some change.&quot;. After Space Quest 5 was released, Sierra 
              decided they wanted another Space Quest and called upon Scott Murphy 
              to do it. However, he was then busy programming for Police Quest 
              4, so Sierra recruited Josh Mandel instead. Scott later joined the 
              team as creative consultant, but ended up having influences on storyline 
              and design as well. Shortly before Space Quest 6 was finished, Josh 
              left the project and Scott was left with the job of getting Space 
              Quest 6 done.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scott 
              Murphy was working on Space Quest 7 for a short period of time, 
              together with, Leslie Balfour, Jay Lee, Bill Shockley, Mark Aro, 
              Richard Powell, Lori Lucia and Craig Alexander. Around February 
              1998, romours spread that Scott was fired and would supposibly be 
              re-hired if the SQ7 project was ever restarted, as was the case 
              in January/February 1999. However, on the 22nd of February 1999, 
              Chainsaw Monday struck, and Scott Murphy had to leave Sierra as 
              his contract was expired and was not being renewed.</font></p>

              Sadly, I don't know what Scott Murphy is doing at the moment. Numerous 
              attempts to get into contact with him have failed. You can visit

              Mark Crowe has been at Sierra On-Line since 1983, first at what 
              became Sierra Publishing, and eventually at Dynamix in Eugene, Oregon. 
              Mark tells it this way:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I 
              started with Sierra in the Art Department, designing packaging and 
              documentation and what not, so I used my illustration skills there. 
              My first computer graphics project was creating the graphics for 
              Winnie the Pooh and the One Hundred Acre Wood. Then I did animation 
              for King's Quest 2 and then Black Cauldron. Black Cauldron was the 
              first project Scott Murphy and I worked on together.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              second project was to be Space Quest I. Mark and Scott knew there 
              was an audience for a funny science fiction game. After designing 
              SQ1, SQ2, SQ3 and SQ4 with Scott Murphy, Mark moved to Sierra's 
              sister company Dynamix. According to Craig Alexander (general project 
              manager of the first cancelled Space Quest 7), Sierra was swamped 
              with projects in Oakhurst. Dynamix volunteered to do the next SQ, 
              and Mark Crowe wanted to move to Dynamix anyway, so he grabbed the 
              opportunity. Mark Crowe himself tells the story this way: &quot;Let's 
              see. It was back in '90/'91 that I was directing Police Quest 3 
              after Space Quest 4 was released. SQ4 had been a particularly stressful 
              development (I still consider it to be my masterpiece product) and 
              I was ready to move on to something different for my next project. 
              I was impressed with the work Jeff Tunnel was doing at Dynamix, 
              and was ready for a life change so I came on board there in Eugene, 
              Oregon. I had a few product ideas in mind that utilized Dynamix' 
              adventure gamer development system, but shortly after my arrival, 
              I was asked to do SQ5 using Sierra's SCI.&quot; Scott Murphy stayed 
              working in Oakhurst and they would never again work together on 
              a Space Quest game. Mark Crowe continues: &quot;I was aware that 
              Josh Mandel (co designer of SQ6 -ed) was working on a design for 
              SQ5 at that point of time. I don't know about all the politics surrounding 
              that. They asked me to do SQ5, I had some ideas for a story so I 
              said SURE!&quot; Mark Crowe did a great job, but it was to be his 
              last Space Quest.</font></p>

              Josh started at Sierra On-Line in 1990 as an assistant producer, 
              his first project being the SCI remake of King's Quest 1. But he 
              preferred to spend his time writing sarcastic texts for any designer 
              who'd let him. Unkowingly for many Space Quest fans, Josh Mandel 
              did a huge amount of &quot;behing the scenes&quot; work for the 
              Space Quest Series as contributing writer. Scott Murphy and Mark 
              Crowe gave him his first opportunity by allowing him to write the 
              parody software boxes and bogus hint book for Space Quest 4. He 
              was, in fact, working on a design for Space Quest 5 for a short 
              period of time. But that before Mark Crowe was allocated to the 
              project. Besides the Space Quest Series, he has been a contributing 
              writer on most Sierra adventures, as well as director, writer and 
              co-designer of Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Josh 
              Mandel set out to design Space Quest 6 but just as the project neared 
              completion, Josh had to leave the project. Scott Murphy did the 
              rest. Space Quest 6 was market as a 'Scott Murphy solo job'. But 
              in fact Josh had designed the whole game. Scott: &quot;I want to 
              publicly apologize to Josh for this. It was a difficult situation 
              for both of us. The 'solo job' thing I honestly had no clue about 
              until I got my packaged copy of the game. Anyway, Josh did get screwed 
              over and I hope he accepts my too-late apology for any part I may 
              have played. I made a mistake I'm not proud of.&quot;</font></p>
