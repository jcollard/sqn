              everybody! Thanks for visiting my website; one of the last active 
              Space Quest fansites out there. Let me introduce myself. My name 
              is Frans van Hofwegen (20 years old). I live in the fine, but boring, 
              town of Nijmegen in the Netherlands close to the German borders. 
              Let me tell you how I bummed into Sierra and their great games.</font> 
            </p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFB1" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
              Early Days</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <img src="IK6.jpg" alt="The 19-year old version" width="150" height="230" align="left">My 
              dad bought our first computer (a 80286 with an ega card and colour 
              monitor) back in 1988. My three brothers and I spent many hours 
              on this machine, doing nothing more than staring at the screen and 
              pushing those buttons. I really liked one particular game that came 
              with the computer namely &quot;Space Quest Chapter I: The Sarien 
              Encounter&quot;. Back then, I was five years old and didn't understand 
              much English. It was my two older brothers who helped Roger through 
              his first adventure and it took them months. But I was right there 
              watching their progress on the Arcada. I didn't understood anything 
              of the texts but the pictures sure looked neat. I wanted to play 
              my own Space Quest, so whenever the computer was free (rare occasion) 
              I would enter the same words as my brothers did, with a dictionary 
              as my only help.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two 
              years later (1990 I guess) we got a copy of Space Quest 3, my favorite 
              Space Quest (I consider it to be the best computer game ever made). 
              Space Quest 3 was a great challenge for my brother Tijn and his 
              friends Guido and Daan. It was sure great to watch them play. I 
              remember the first time I saw my favorite character Fester Blatz 
              and his spiffy shop World O' Wonders. Once again, I was intrigued 
              by the great science fiction graphics. Of course, I continued to 
              learn more and more English. I just had to know why they where laughing. 
              My next Space Quest (does this guy never shut up?) was Space Quest 
              5. Sadly, I didn't play that one myself because it was removed because 
              of some computer virus. Too bad! My brothers lost interest in Space 
              Quest as the years came and went... But I didn't...</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              must be somewhere around 1996 when I stumbled across Space Quest 
              2 on a computer at school. I had played it for a few times only 
              before the computer was removed.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again 
              some years later, my dad realized it was time for a new computer. 
              In those days, everybody already had CD-Rom, soundcards and even 
              internet! Even I couldn't impress my friends anymore with our trusty 
              old 80286. I was still playing Space Quest 1 over and over again. 
              I think I must have played it over a thousand times, really! Anyway, 
              our second computer was a fine Pentium 200 MMX. And sweet mother 
              of God, look at the size of that screen! It must be at least 17&quot;! 
              A few weeks after that, Pieter (my oldest brother) came home with.... 
              * Drum role please * .... The Space Quest Collection! It cost me 
              45 bucks to buy it from him, but it was worth the money. All the 
              Space Quest games in one box and Space Quest 7 was going to be released 
              in 1998!</font></p>

              and I both got into HTML and using Fortuncity (a free website host) 
              and he asked me the other day: &quot;Waarom maak je geen website 
              over Space Quest?&quot;. For our non-Dutch visitors (nobody's perfect): 
              &quot;Why don't you make a website about Space Quest?&quot; I replied: 
              &quot;GREAT IDEA!&quot;. So the next few months I was working day 
              and night on that site. I started &quot;The Frans and Bart Page&quot; 
              along with Bart Stadelmann (a friend and classmate at the time). 
              The first version appeared online somewhere in the winter months 
              of 1998 (probably late October). Our website featured two chapters: 
              Space Quest and Gabriel Knight. Our favorite Sierra games. The website 
              was extremely crappy, made with the cheap HTML-editor Frontpage2000. 
              That site was screaming: &quot;I'm made by highschool students without 
              HTML knowledge, I look crappy!&quot; A few months later, the site 
              was hacked by a computer nerd in our class. Not soon afterwards, 
              we (Bart and me) went our own seperate ways. His site died out rather 
              quickly (although still online to this date). He couldn't push himself 
              to re-create all that was lost (we didn't do no pussy back-ups back 
              then). I almost stopped too, but I got around re-doing a lot of 
              work and put together a new version.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              pictures you see here are one of the first images I did for the 
              site, and the only two to survive the hack. A funny note: The Space 
              Quest 3 Fanfiction page about Monolith Burger was one of the first 
              pages I made. It's still online to this date.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              July 2000, I was in the middle of redesigning the looks of the website 
              using the Trellix webeditor for Fortunecities when the update craze 
              came to a sudden stop: putting a halt to 1.5 years of hard work 
              on the site. The main reason why I stopped updating was the lack 
              of visitors I was getting, the fact Space Quest 7 was cancelled 
              months earlier (on February the 22nd, 1999) and, most notably, because 
              I had overwritten a HUGE chunk of work on my harddisk by accident. 
              I just couldn't make myself do get work done.</font></p>

              a year later (in June 2001) I had this urge to revive the site (after 
              not having touched it for a whole year). I invested almost all of 
              my free summer days making a new design. I decided Trellix and Fortunecity 
              wasn't going to cut it, so I used Dreamwaver 4 and a Geocities website 
              instead (click on the picture to the left for a screenshot of the 
              July 2001 to March 2002 version). Some weeks later, school term 
              started, but I continued to invest huge amounts of time in the website. 
              All the hard work was not in vain, as the amount of visitors increased 
              tremendously from 105 per month by June 2001, to 699 per month by 
              July 2001. The site began to crossing the three gigabyte datalimit 
              from Geocities, causing the entire site to be shut down. Asthonished 
              by the fact my site was getting popular so quickly, I was thinking 
              about the possibility of having my own domainname. Geocities was 
              just starting to offer &quot;professional packages&quot; which included 
              a domainname, extra server space and more bandwidth. All for a very 
              reasonable price. Another advantage was an ad-free site, and it 
              could still be accessed using the geocities address. It was just 
              what I needed. The domainname <img src="../extraimages/sqnet.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="87" height="11"> 
              was bought on the 17th of September 2001. I decided to go for that 
              particular name because .com, .org and http://www.wiw.org/~jess/roger.html 
              were already taken. A funny note: I was owner of spacequest.nl for 
              a very short time, but I cancelled it because I thought the name 
              spacequest.net had more future.</font></p>

              When Wet!&quot;. This design took the website to an even higher 
              level. I was getting over 5000 visitors a month at the end of its 
              lifetime. Quite an achievement, don't you agree? I'm still very 
              attached to the simplicity of this design, but it had served for 
              over 18 months. It was time to scrap it and look ahead.</font></p>

              his ass of during a four month period and got up with a terrific 
              design. We introduced several truly unique features. Think about 
              the neat pop up windows and online QuickTime video's. But also content-wise, 
              like the awesome design sketches from the cancelled SQ7. We definitely
