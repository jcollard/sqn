      move your mouse pointer over them! It was a lot of work to make them, but

    I've added information, news and screen shots from the upcoming fangames
    section. But more about that with the next update in January. I've also added
    a complete new page to the fanfiction section. It's about Space Quest 2
    remake images by &quot;Blackthorne519&quot;, &quot;JLM5&quot;, &quot;Khaveen&quot;, &quot;moonlit&quot; (my
    favorite images, recognizible from the sparkling fluorescent green colours)
    and &quot;JayWar&quot;. I hope I haven't forgot any artists. In any case,
    awesome work guys! Do check out their discussion at the

    get banned from the server! There's a restriction of 500MB for the rest of
    the website. Please note that these are most generous bandwidth amounts.
    With normal surfing you'll never cross that amount.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've decided
    to go back to Eperfect.net;
    the best hosting company. They hosted SpaceQuest.Net in
    the past but I reluctantly left because the website had outgrown their largest
    available hosting solution. When I contacted them about a week ago with the
    question if they could set up a custom solution specifically for my website,
    they said &quot;Sure we can!&quot;. What's more, they're kindly sponsoring
    SpaceQuest.Net! They're hosting me a bit cheaper than they would normally
    do. Thanks to Eperfect.net I
    can continue offering all the games, including Space Quest 6, without any
    compromise! The games have been moved to their own specific hosting account,
    limited to no less than 170 gigabyte a month. Thank you Eperfect.net!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you're
    looking for a website host or server space, then do sign up with Eperfect.net.
    Best quality servers and best customer support I've ever seen. Between you
    and me, that is saying something.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the
    meantime, there's still a lot of work to be done. Please have some patience
    while I restore the message board, the subdomains, custom error pages and
    all that nonsense. I'm in the middle of setting up the games downloads (games.spacequest.net).
    This takes a while because it's, well you know, 1.5 gigabyte. Everything
    should be up and running around tomorrow evening. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you

Quest Fans,</font></p>

      addressing this letter to all you Space Quest Fans out there, in particular
      regular SpaceQuest.Net visitors. Colin Davis just contacted me with sad
    news. Recently, the server has been the victim of mindless hacker attacks.
    To be
      able to protect the server against these useless and moronic acts, server
      costs have gone up 200%. Neither of us are able to affort that. Colin
      decided not renew the contract for his private server, on which SpaceQuest.Net
  is hosted. The server will be closed at the end of January.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finding
    a new suitable host for SpaceQuest.Net won't be easy. There's a trade off
    to make between how much money to pay each month and the package I'll get
    in return. It should be clear that SpaceQuest.Net will never be able to have
    the server capacity it has now (unless I pay a hosting company $100 dollars
    a month), simply because Colin's gracious and selfless support throughout
    the past two years. Thank you Colin, without your support SpaceQuest.Net
    would never have grown into the site it is today. You will remain this website's
    greatest supporter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm therefore
    turning to you, visitor, with a heavy heart. I would like to ask you to consider
    donating money so that I can afford a new suitable hosting solution. Simply
    click on the image below to make a donation using your paypal account (sign
    up for one if you have a credit card: it's free). Any donations of $1 and
    up are greatly appreciated. If you would like to donate money using the old
    fasion way (snail mail), please contact me for my address.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hosting
    this website will cost AT LEAST $25 dollars a month. That's AT LEAST $300
    dollars for just one year hosting. A sum not many students are able to afford
    and sadly I fall into that category. The more donations I get in, the larger
    server package I'll be able to afford. It's as simple as that. But make no
    mistake, whatever server solution I'll purchase, it won't be nearly as good
    as the one Colin offered me. This means the SQ6 download, for instance, will
    most certainly disappear. Before donating, please keep in mind that it won't
    be easy for me to continue updating the website in the first place. You're
    not donating money to help me continue updating. You will be donating to
    keep the website online!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't let
    SpaceQuest.Net close! We have until the end of January before they pull the
    plug. A satisfactory solution must be found before that time. I know many
    of you will be most eager to help me and I encourage everybody to send in
    suggestions. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The future
    of SpaceQuest.Net is in your very own hands. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There

        Kimball announced a new Doom3 mod on August 30th. Since Reid start working
        on the
      mod, he has built a
      small website and got some attention over at the Doom3
      gaming community. Far more interesting is a set of screenshots he has
      released, which you can find on his website. This project should be closely
  watched!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#CC0000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Update
    (16 November): Reid has just released a
    video teaser. It's simply stunning. Even more
    so when considering there's still a lot of work to be done. Like adding lightning,
    textures and descreasing the &quot;emptyness&quot; to create that true Sierra
    feeling.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the
    other side of our galaxy, the good people of Vohaul
    Strikes Back are making good progress with their fangame and SQ7.Org is
    simmering along nicely as usual. Colin Davis, project manager, has recently
    asked for more 3D artists and programmers. So if you're extremely hot with
    3D and stuff and want to work on the most ambitious fanproject ever attempted
    then join the project! A release date is not expected soon but then again
    the project doesn't have a budget. Just sit tight, it'll be done when it's
    done. There are a few individuals working on a new fangame called &quot;Vohaul's
    Mines&quot;. Not much is known about the project but their game basically
    is an alternative SQ2. What if the hoovercraft that took Roger to the mines
    didn't crashed? Looks like we're going to find out. That is, if the game
    gets finished. Good old Vonster (creator of The Lost Chapter fangame) is
    helping out. The team has released three
    early beta screenshots, ranging from &quot;very interesting&quot; to &quot;too
    cliche&quot;. None the less, it's an interesting concept for a fanproject
    indeed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There you
    have it, fans! A total news update on the fangame scene!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the
    websites updates then. I've uploaded the
    French version of Space Quest 4. I have a copy of Space Quest 3 translated
    into Chinese, but sadly one of the disks is corrupt so it's useless. I love
    5.25&quot; disks, don't you? I'm calling out to those who might have that
    version laying around somewhere. Or any other language / (platform) version
    of a game I don't have yet. Please contact
    me if you do... Then we also have a new
    SQ5 Plot Inconsistency,  two SQ4 Funfacts and a
    new fix for SQ4. Lastly is a
    cool new fanimage by &quot;Shadow&quot;.</font></p>

      a warm welcome! Today is a very special day because SpaceQuest.Net celebrates
      its 6th year online! That's 2190 days, 52560 hours, 3153600 minutes, 189216000
      seconds, and still counting! Amazing how time passes by so quickly. In celebration
  of 6 years online, I've got some cool updates for you.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fanfiction
    finally got its well-deserved place at SpaceQuest.Net.
    In the Miscellaneous chapter you can now find a revamped section about the
    Fan Phenomena. I personally find it a bit lacking, but I'm sure that'll change
    in the future. Also new: the revamped contact
    page, two new sq5 funfacts, two
    new sq1 references, a sq3
    funfact, a new sq5 spoof, a new sq6
    spoof and last but not least the revamped about
    page. It now contains much more background information about the early
    days. Worth reading if you appreciate SpaceQuest.Net and
    that wacko who built the damn thing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also new
    are the split &quot;fixes&quot; from the &quot;patches&quot; sections for
    (nearly) every Space Quest chapter. I hope to greatly expand these pages
    to offer the best possible technical support a fansite has ever seen. If
    you don't mind me saying, we're already going in the right direction. Wouldn't
    you agree?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the
    fans had a huge part in today's update as well. So first, let me extend my
    thanks to those who contributed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Khaveen
    contributed the awesome Flash animation you've see on the introduction
    page. He also contributed the Russian versions of Space
    Quest 4 and <a href="sq5/thegame/index.shtml">5</a>. Bountice offered
    the French version of SQ6. This download is temporary and will be deleted
    at the end of November. Consider this download &quot;an Anniversary special&quot;. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shadow
    contributed a rare SQ box for the misc
    chapter. Blusk contributed an excellent picture of how Roger will look
    upon retirement. Saving the universe does have its impact on Rog, you know.
    The picture can be found at the
    new Fan Phenomena section.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justas
    made an &quot;anniversary special&quot; for
    the occasion. I can't help but to wonder what the true reason was for making
    this flash animation. Recently, Justas started experimenting with Flash and
    it seems nobody has noticed his work, so obviously the best way to get attention
    is to exploit SpaceQuest.Net.
    Thanks anyway Justas, you know I care. :) But the fun isn't stopping here.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Then we
    have Richard D'Sane who asked me to bring his
    fanproject to your attention. Project Space Quest V 1/5 - Future's Part
    is looking an artist. Maybe you're interested in helping out creating a fangame?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please
    toast to SpaceQuest.Net tonight.
    May it be around next year for another celebration!</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, what

    have noticed that &quot;Roger
    Wilco's Virtual Broomcloset&quot;, the first Space Quest website ever,
    has been offline for a couple of days now. This is due to a major server
    crash. I talked with Jess, the webmaster, and this is what he had to say: &quot;<em>If
    wiw </em>[the domain of his website -ed]<em> doesn't come back up, though,
    I might just put the Broomcloset to bed. [...] There's still a chance things
    will be back up.&quot;</em> I hope Jess doesn't mind me informing you guys
    about this. So a bit of sad news, indeed. Whatever the future brings, you
    can be sure that SpaceQuest.Net keeps
    you up to date. <font color="#FF0000">Update: Website is back online!</font></font></p>

      I've added some Apple II, Macintosh and Amiga versions of the games and even
      Spanish versions of SQ1 to 5! Looks like my call from the previous update
      didn't go unnoticed. I thank those who had a part in this update. But this
      doesn't mean that &quot;the game&quot; sections are complete. I'm still

    several additions to the Space Quest 6

    knew any better, I would have thought Justas got a bit eccentric himself,
    but I know for a fact the guy on the photo isn't Justas. Hell, I wish I could

      was a pretty bumpy ride. For those of you who weren't around, SpaceQuest.Net
      was closed for 1.5 days at the end of the month because the bandwidth limit
      of the server account was reached! Not since the Geocities era did SpaceQuest.Net
      close down due to bandwidth limitations. A few peculiar happenings made this
      possible. I was late disabling the downloads of the games on June the 2nd.
      The server handled 28 GB in just two days, which is over 50% of SQN's total
      bandwidth limit. Normally, I disable the downloads manually at 25 GB, so
      I missed it with 3GB. Please note that 28 GB of traffic in just two days
      is an outrageous amount of traffic, even more so when considering that SpaceQuest.Net
      normally handles 15 GB a month. But that was before the new design and the
      games... Second, some guy submitted a torrent file (SQ collection cd's in
      ISO file + manual scans from this website) to bittorrent and included a link
      to my website. This single action alone resulted in 1167 visits on the 12th
      of June, a new day record. June 2004 has been the most visited month overall
too (thanks to that link), with 8220 UNIQUE visits at 550 seconds per visit. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Colin Davis,
    that great bloke from SQ7.Org (and my server admin), decided to DOUBLE SpaceQuest.Net's
    bandwidth limit to an astronomical 100GB a month, free of charge. This outruns
    most popular porn websites out there, let me tell ya! Thanks a lot Colin! </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If
    you don't have a clue what all this bandwidth talk is about, let me just
    conclude with the following: SpaceQuest.Net is doing great. It's getting
    more and more visitors each month. The magical 10,000 visitor barrier is
    in sight, I'd say! </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Talking
    about Colin Davis and SQ7.Org, the team just recently launched a brand new
    website design! Go check it out.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's
    also some sad news. Well, it's only sad from a certain perspective anyway.
    Sierra On-Line no longer exists. The critters at Vivendi (owners of the Sierra
    division) closed down Sierra's Bellevue offices on the 21st of June, laying
    off 350 people (40% of Vivendi's total workforce in the US). Looks like this
    was to be expected since Dynamix and Impressions Games were closed some months
    earlier... I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard is the next one on top of
    their list. It is to be questioned whether this is such a bad thing for the
    computer gaming industry, since Sierra produced nothing but utter crap for
    the past 7 years anyway (with Lords of the Realm 3 being their latest addition
    to their ever growing list of crap &amp; trash). Let's hope all this restructuring
    will cost Vivendi its head. Go Vivendi! Anyway, hear me ranting off topic!
    This barely has anything to do with Space Quest!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's move
    on to the updates, shall we? I've added an additional fact about Roger's
    boots to the SQ3 plot inconsistency page. I've added some Escape Factory
    news to the Space Quest 7 chapter. This will probably be the last update
    to the Escape Factory page, mind. The update can be found at the bottom of
    the page: record March 24, 2004. You will find an interesting PowerPoint
    presentation there, made by James Gertzman (former CEO of Escape Factory).
    The presentation offers a number of interesting insights in the now defunct
    rumoured SQ project. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've

  You see, the new Scrolling Screen article was planned for release about 3 years

  brainfart and was realized in just one (!!!) night. I literally decided overnight 
  that the previous design was limiting me too much in the creative process. It 
  was time consuming to make even the simplest addition. Also, the funfact pages 
  became over 35 KB and over 8 A4 sheets of paper long (if you had the courage 
  to print them). It all became one big pile, really. So, after an entire night 
  of crunching, I've came up with the design you see here. Quite the improvement, 
  don't you agree? Implementing the design took about 4 to 5 days and testing 
  yet another.</font></p>

  recommended with the latest version (7.5 or up). Also keep in mind that this 
  website is designed for a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 and up. 800 x 600 
  users will experience a problem with the tab menu you see here on top of the 
  screen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Miscellaneous 
  part of the website is under heavy construction, so please don't worry if there 
  are some faulty things in there. Thanks to this new design, I will be able to 
  implement the SQFAQ even better, so expect to see a lot of small updates the 
  coming days. But that's for later. For now, please enjoy the new design. For 
  an interesting retrospective, take a look at the &quot;about this website&quot;

  Strikes Back! </strong></font><font color="#6666FF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>- 
  News: Wednesday 28 April, 2004<br>
  </em></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the last 
  two years, fanprojects have been THE most important factor of the Space Quest 
  Community. Since Space Quest 7 was cancelled and Sierra killed off Roger Wilco 
  &quot;indefinitely&quot; - as they called it (He isn't just taking a break, 
  Scott!) - many fans started fanprojects in one way or another, mostly full length 
  adventure games. All with a common goal: to prevent our favorite anti-hero from 
  fading out the adventure gaming spotlights. Some of these projects have become 
  legends and well-known (no need to mention the Lost Chapter and Replicated), 
  while others are happily forgotten. A quick look at the SQFanGames website shows 
  the buzz the word &quot;fangame&quot; seems to trigger. Luckily for the integrity 
  of Space Quest, many of these well-meant projects never see the light of day 
  or have been cancelled and forgotten already.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It looks 
  like at least one of these fanprojects have got their things sorted out. &quot;Vohaul 
  Strikes Back&quot; has had the usual ups and downs all fanprojects must experience 
  one time or another, but is doing rather well. Today, SpaceQuest.Net is proud 
  to congratulate the project with its second anniversary. Yep, you heard it right, 
  VSB (Vohaul Strikes Back) has been in production for exactly two years now. 
  And that's saying something! </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They've 
  recently set up a new website along with their own domain name! - www.vohaulstrikesback.com</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The whole 
  thing started way back on the 28th of April, 2002 when Frederik &quot;Olzen&quot; 
  Olsen got an idea for a fangame. The game was going to involve a cyborg Vohaul 
  trying to get his revenge on Roger once again. The project started out real 
  good but since Frederik's leadership skills aren't very good (please, don't 
  take my word for it), the production slowed down to a halt some months later. 
  Figuring leading a game wasn't his thing, Frederik installed a new leader and 
  the team got their second wind. However, the relationship between members wasn't 
  exactly stable and people kept joining and leaving the project, a trend that 
  continued for months on end. I guess even a big pile of beans couldn't produce 
  the new winds they needed forever. So finally after having caught their third, 
  fourth, fifth and even a sixth wind, the team decided to cut the crap and get 
  serious. Their current line-up looks like this:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Pcj - teamlead, 
  modeller and programmer<br>
  Kainenable - co-lead, character modeller, website designer<br>
  Olzen - co-lead and assistant writer<br>
  Eegah - lead writer<br>
  Justas - assistant writer, quality control lead<br>
  Captain Nige - songwriter<br>
  Marty McFly - backgrounds<br>
  BlueMax - music<br>
  MusicallyInspired - guitarist on main theme</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, how's 
  - and more importantly WHAT'S - the project doing? Well, scriptwork has been 
  the busiest area of development. Benjamin &quot;Eegah&quot; Vigeant is working 
  on combining the only remaining major continuous chunk of old, rough and outdated 
  scripts to form a coherent and logically connected block. Andres &quot;Justas&quot; 
  Kalle and Frederik &quot;Olzen&quot; Olsen are working on going through all 
  the old scripts, filling up any missing parts, cutting and/or improving the 
  weak stuff, as well as adding new puzzles and sequences. The backgrounds, an 
  astonishing one-man job by Martin &quot;Marty McFly&quot; deMontfort, are most 
  likely the most impressive part of the game. Currently, about 80% of the total 
  background work is done. The character models are almost completed, with only 
  a few left to do. The team is currently experimenting with some new cel-shading 
  techniques to ensure a better match with the style of the backgrounds. The musical 
  composing department is making slow progress and still needs a lot of work. 
  Coding hasn't begun yet, but the team is experimenting with the engine, the 
  Adventure Game Studio, and released two testing demos for internal work.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So yes, 
  it is going to be one huge Space Quest, possibly passing all the games in the 
  original series by its length. Only the future can show what's going to happen 
  next. They're hell-bent on finishing it and they promise to deliver a quality 
  product worthy bearing the name &quot;Space Quest&quot;! Blasting to your computer 
  in late 2004 / early 2005.</font></p>

  of course.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
  Wintermute74 and New Rising Sun (members of our message board the Janitorial 
  Times) found out that the resource files of the PC version aren't any different, 
  which means DOS can produce the &quot;where am I?&quot; sound effect too (and 
  possibly a lot more). They found out there's a problem with the sound driver 
  that shipped with the game. It took a bit of research, but they have successfully 
  solved this problem. Please check out the download page, under patches. Download

  submitted some cool news today: &quot;Space Quest was briefly on TV last night. 
  It was on the GSN channel. The documentary was called &quot;Video Game Invasion: 
  the History of a Global Obsession&quot; It was about the evolution of video 
  games. During the show there was a part that talk about Sierra and it's effect 
  on video games. It was during this that for a brief second they showed Space 
  Quest (Snap Shot of the Box Art).&quot; </font> </p>

  network for games, is the only U.S. television network dedicated to game-related 
  programming and interactive game playing. Pretty nice news, though it's sad 
  Space Quest was shown only briefly. The Series have become underrated and forgotten, 
  even among other old games.</font></p>

  </em></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's a new 
  guy in town who calls himself NewRisingSun. He has managed to produce a set 
  of patches that fix the well-hated timer problems by going right to the source: 
  &quot;The previous project, the experimental timer fixes, sought to work around 
  faulty script code by patching a frame-limiter into the interpreter executable. 
  The new project goes after the faulty script code directly. Not only is this 
  approach &quot;cleaner&quot; and more professional (this is the way Sierra would 
  fix the bugs if they bothered to), it also saves me from providing separate 
  patches for DOS and Windows. The fixes are also easier to apply; you just extract 
  the .zip archives into the game's directory, and you're done.&quot;</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for me,

  Again a Space Quest 7 update. I guess I'm starting to sound just like one of 
  those Dragon Ball cartoons. Every time you think it's over, there's more. Except 
  one minor difference: the stuff I dig up doesn't bore people to death like those 
  cartoons do... At least, I hope. Anyway, today's update features all of Tim 
  Loucks' awesome 3D work. You might not have heard of him because he wasn't a 
  big player around the Space Quest Series. He worked on the Space Quest 7 project 
  as 3D artist just before it was cancelled. His job was to turn Richard Powell's 
  design sketches into 3D art. Sadly, he only managed to work on one or three 
  thingies. One or three awesomely cool thingies, mind you. Check out the new 
  page in the Space Quest 7 section.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've also 
  done a ton &quot;too-small-to-notice-updates&quot; during the last few days 
  of 2003. I've added a SQ4 and a SQ6 funfact, added yet another Box Art scan, 
  and tweaked the Space Quest Library a bit.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Possibly 
  far more interesting: I've received word that Vivendi's much discussed highly 
  secretive Space Quest project, which was supposedly cancelled after Escape Factory 
  (who supposedly worked on it) went out of business, is still being worked on. 
  You heard me right! Though, it looks like the project's future is VERY uncertain 
  at this point of time. It is very much dependant on the outcome of some sort 
  of buyout. Mind you, if you don't mind me saying, it looks to me that Vivendi 
  isn't exactly on top of things. It's pretty much storming there right about 
  now. Even the employers don't know what is happening, what will happen and what 
  happened... Still with me? What I'm trying to say is, I can tell you what Vivendi 
  is doing/planning/working on right now, but that can change pretty much at any 
  moment. Just like past Escape Factory rumours, this one is surrounded in as 
  much controversy and secrecy. So don't get your hopes up. I wish I could tell 
  you guys more than just this feeble rumour. After all, I think we Space Quest 
  fans deserve just that. But sadly I can't. Not because I was asked not to say 
  anything, but simply because I don't know more than I just told you. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I guess 
  us Space Quest fans will have to sit back again and wait what happens. Ooh, 
  and I wish you a happy and healthy 2004.</font></p>
