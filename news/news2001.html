  - At last! After three (make that four) days, spacequest.net is back online. 
  I apologize for the fact that I couldn't inform you guys about this. But Geocities 
  took my site out of the air because of one of their bullshit rules. I even paid 
  for that site! But none the less, I had to deal with the same rules as a free 
  websites. I think this is unacceptable, and I have moved. Now I have 150 MB!

  - You can now take a look at the scans of the second issue of the Roger Wilco 
  Comics series.<br>
  - I'm planning to redesign the whole site! It will be more suitable for 800

  and add inventory items to all the current Space Quest chapters. After that,
  I'll start making the Space Quest 5 chapter. The first thing it will have will
  be the original hints, and the Galactic Inquirer magazine! Some plans huh?</font></p>

  - I have plans to buy some extra space and a domainname for this site at Geocities.
  I crossed the 3 gigabyte/month data limit! You guys are really making me go
  bankrupt! Anyway, this will also relieve my site of all the advertisement.
  Keep visiting my site!<br>
  - New section opened! Take a look at the misc section. It is really a rough 
  beta, but it has some pretty neat stuff already.<br>
  - I'm trying to scan some manuals and books for this site. I hope I'll have
  some pictures soon. This all depends on my school schedule. I'm pretty busy
  at the moment, but I assure you; the scans will be great.<br>
  - Updated 1001 small things.<br>
  - The contest is closed! I decided to close down the contest one day earlier,
  due to circumstances. The winners: Alisha won Space Quest 2, Bjorn won the
  Space Quest 5 hint book, And the webmaster of SierraClassics.cjb.net won Space
  Quest 5. </font></p>
