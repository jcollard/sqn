  Update: Wednesday 17 December, 2003</em></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  I've updated the Timer Issue page, adding a few nifty patches for the Space 
  Quest games. They are experimental, so be sure to provide feedback. It all becomes 
  clear if you go there now. It's there on the bottom of the article.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, I've 
  finally added a funfact about Space Quest 4, concerning a typo on one of the 
  cd labels. I meant to do it earlier, but somehow I didn't.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A more exciting 
  update is the launch of a new Miscellanious section, called &quot;The Space 
  Quest Library&quot;, or SQL for short. Its purpose is to protect the games against 
  the hands of time by means of conserving them online. This new page is the face 
  of an underlaying exchange program that tries to gather all those different 
  game versions onto one digital shelve. Great, you think, so I can now download 
  the Space Quest games from your website? Nope sorry, you can't. That's not why 
  this page is here for. Please read on, and it will all become clear to you.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Christmas

  Er, I mean <em>school</em>. Heck, I could use a break from working on this website 
  too, so I guess you can call this the Christmas update. I wish you all some 
  VERY happy days. I do hope to update this website one more time before the year's 
  over. I've got something terrific coming up (won't tell nothing). </font></p>

  Hey all! SpaceQuest.Net has once again changed servers. The current home offers 
  a truck load more webspace and a scary amount of bandwidth (which is even of 
  higher quality then before). This means SpaceQuest.Net has found a solution 
  for its most fundamental problem: Being able to continue to grow at the same 
  rate as it has done for the last two years while at the same time being able 
  to offer even more downloads, higher resolution scans and images.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The website 
  should be in complete working order. The Janitorial Times, our message board, 
  was offline for a few hours due to a database problem. But I'm happy to report 
  it's in working order again. If you haven't visited the Janitorial Times yet: 
  it is an excellent place to discuss Space Quest and ask for game help or technical 
  support. It's also a great place to submit suggestions about my website and 
  discuss the latest updates.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is, of 
  course, possible a problem has gone unnoticed. If you have noticed something 
  out of the ordinary while surfing this website, then please don't hesitate to 
  contact me.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, 
  the only drawback of this story is money. These kind of high quality webserver 
  packages are expensive, and I hope I can count on fellow fans to help me out 
  with the server bills a bit.</font></p>

  Update: Friday 5 December, 2003</em></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  A few days ago, I was taken by surprise to find a generous amount of design 
  sketches from Shawn Sharp in my snailmail box. I was extremely excited to find 
  that quite a few of them hadn't been scanned by Shawn himself for the Special 
  here on SpaceQuest.Net a few days ago. Naturally, I began scanning immediately 
  and I've added these &quot;exclusives&quot; to the Space Quest 5 Design Sketches 
  page. A funny note: two of these sketches show a version of Flo which differs 
  from the actual game.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But that's 
  not all what's new today. I've added a Space Quest 4 funfact which is about 
  a very interesting screen that, apparently, didn't make it in the actual game. 
  More news about this (along with a screen shot of course) can be found at the 
  Space Quest 4 funfacts page. Thanks to Curt Espinoza for his addition.</font></p>

      Times Here Again? </strong></font><font color="#6666FF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>- 
      Space Quest Universe News: Friday 5 December, 2003</em></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      I can't help but to feel extremely excited about recent developments in 
      the community. The 8th Anniversary of the Virtual Broomcloset once again 
      fired up the flame that was slowly fading. One of the new additions to this 
      website is an image donated by Marty who, if I recall correctly, works for 
      the Vohaul Strikes Back fanproject. Besides that this simple image basically 
      reflects what this entire community is about, it also shows the enormous 
      amount of graphical talent of the Vohaul Strikes Back fanproject.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Then 
      there is that preview about the SQ2 novilization. I've read it and I'm stunned. 
      This is something of the quality that our own Troels Pleimert could have 
      produced. We've seen it before, he has written novels before. I wouldn't 
      be surprised if this is his work. The atmosphere and feeling of the preview 
      gave me the shivers. It shows exactly how Vohaul is. How he is meant to 
      be like. Almost like Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter Series. Creatures 
      do not speak of him and are afraid to death to even come close to him. Awesome. 
      If the rest of this novel has this outrageous high standard... Then we're 
      in for a treat.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      above are just two cool updates from the Virtual Broomcloset, which is celebrating 
      its 8th (!!!) Anniversary! Many more years to go, I hope.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even 
      closer to home (my home anyway), I've received 14 truly unique sketches 
      from Shawn Sharp yesterday in my smailmail. The sketches are the VERY same 
      as used later on in the original game which was released 10 years ago. Yes, 
      it's been that long. Time could not touch the talent and geniusly of his 
      work.. The sketches are truly the most precious addition of my collection, 
      and probably also the most unique collectibles out there. My website will 
      soon be updated with these &quot;exclusives&quot;. Isn't this so cool? When 
      looking at these sketches, able to see every tiny pencil stroke, I can almost 
      see Shawn drawing up these sketches while working along with Mark Crowe 
      and David Selle. Click here for more.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
      we have, of course, the second Anual Spoof Contest. It's increadible how 
      many more people submitted entry's as opposed to last year.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
      of course, not forgetting our own Dee who recently started a new project 
      which tries to unite all the loose fanprojects which got started, canned 
      and cancelled along the way. Although it's hard to predict the outcome of 
      this last project, it shows quite clearly that this community is all but 
      fading. And YOU as fellow fan, poster and contributor help to keep it that 
      way.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent 
      weeks showed how the lines of our strong community are set: The Virtual 
      Broomcloset (celebrating 8 years online this month) in the lead with top 
      notch fan stuff. SQ.Net (celebrating 5 years online last month) closely 
      behind with the most exclusive original first hand material from the actual 
      games and their creators. Then we have some very promissing fanprojects 
      actually in the works. Projects like Vohaul Strikes Back and SQ7.Org.</font></p>

      unusual for me to find time on Monday for a website update. But I got injured 
      in a hockey match last Sunday (in which I acted like a kamikaze pilot), 
      and the injury prevents me from going to school. Stopping a hockey ball 
      traveling about 60 kilometers per hour with your bare knee hurts! ... A 
      lot! So now I'm sitting here at home, unable to do so much as fart without 
      feeling my knee. But hey, it was the save that made us win the match! So 
      I guess it's worth it. Anyway, back to Space Quest. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've

      The other one is an article called &quot;Buying the Games&quot;. It contains

      5th Anniversary!</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you 
      might have noticed, I launched a great new website design today. The graphical 
      design is the outcome of months hard work by fellow Space Quest fan Danny 
      Bloks. Danny and I are very proud to release it today. I sincerely hope 
      you like it. When we set out to design the next look of this website, we 
      wanted to make sure it looked great. Though at the same time, we tried to 
      keep the SpaceQuest.Net legendary easy to use navigation. Naturally, we 
      wanted it to work on the commonly used browsers (I'll come back about that 
      later) and on both broadband and lightweight internet connections (such 
      as the good ol' 56K modems). That, my friends, is one hell of a task. It's 
      not possible to please everybody, but I think I can safely say we've made 
      this design much better than the old one.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
      website is designed for a screen resolution of 1024 X 768 @ million colours 
      (16 bit) or higher. I haven't forgot about you 800 X 600 users, but keep 
      in mind that 800 X 600 is not a recommended resolution for the new design. 
      The menu for instance, will not fit on your screen with that resolution. 
      The website has been successfully tested on a large variety of browsers:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Windows 
        users: Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.3.1 and Opera 7. All 
        these browsers are available for free. I recommend using the newest Internet 
        Explorer.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Macintosh 
        users: Internet Explorer 5.2.3, Safari 1.0 (though the pop up windows 
        are placed randomly. I'm confident future versions won't have this small 
        inconvenience), Camino 0.7, Netscape 7.1 and Mozilla 1.3.1. All these 
        browsers are available for free. Sadly, Opera for Mac is <em><strong>not</strong></em> 
        a recommended browser for this website because of its terrible Java coding. 
        I must add though, that java is not required to view this website, but 
        it will make your life a whole lot easier. I recommend using the newest 
        Safari or Internet Explorer if you're a Macintosh user.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
      is a list of the most important new features:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
        the manuals I've started offering PDF files instead of ZIP archives. I 
        feel PDF offers more advantages. The manuals are now easier to print and 
        you've got all the pages neatly in one file. So say goodbye to those separate 
        files of the ZIP archives... Although that's not entirely true. I've decided 
        to keep the individual files, so you're not forced to use a PDF reader.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've 
        incorporated Javascript pop up windows which can be found throughout the 
        website. This is most obvious in the Screenshot pages.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
        major technical update are all the video files found on this website (for 
        instance: the Space Quest 3 Promo Video and the Current Inside Copy Video). 
        You'll get presented with a pop up window which features an on-line QuickTime 
        video, information about the video and information about the file you're 
        about to download. The QuickTime video is optional eye candy, you don't 
        need to have it installed. Though I highly recommend just that. Get your 
        free QuickTime plug-in today.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
      that's not all what's new today. I've done countless of small updates and 
      improvements across the entire website! The most important updates are listed

      a certain &quot;bear-like&quot; creature that didn't make it into the actual 
      game. But we already knew that, right? ... Just recently, I managed to acquire 
      a PCGames Magazine from December 1989 which features a 4 page-review about 
      Space Quest 3. The review contains a screenshot of this very same bear-like 
      creature, only this time, much larger than the one I originally found in 
      the Sierra Catalogue Summer 1988 edition. I've added a scan of this image 
      to the &quot;bear article&quot; for you to enjoy (or click on the image 
      you see here to the right <font color="#CC0000">(150 KB)</font>)! Read both

      Space Quest website! Today, we got one update to share with you, namely 
      the Space Quest 6 funfact page. It has been updated with all the SQFAQ information

      More slowly than I would have hoped for, but I guess we'll pick up the pace

      I cannot. It will ruin the surprise, won't it?</font></p>

      update. First off, I'd like to thank those who've replied to my Flash animator 
      call (see previous announcement for details). I'd like to say that a highly 
      competent (and secret) team started working on the anniversary update. Although 
      that update is still months ahead of us, it already makes me excited. And 
      that's saying something.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm busy arranging my summer 
      holidays and I'm trying to successfully round off the third year of my study. 
      You know how teachers like to give last minute tests and essays. Further 
      more, I'm a little bit &quot;Space Quest tired&quot; at the moment. Since 
      New Year, I've been updating this website about 4 times each month (not 
      even mentioning the thousand small tweaks and repairs nobody seems to notice), 
      which comes down to about one major update a week. It left me a bit tired... 
      If I can call it that way. In t</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">he coming 
      two months or so it will be pretty quiet around here. Every farmer knows 
      he's got to leave his fields fallow from time to time to ensure good future 
      harvests. I want to enjoy my vacation with doing absolutely nothing but 
      sleeping, drinking a few beers with me buddy's and playing the Return to 
      Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer with my clan... That and some other blatant 
      summer activities you don't want to hear about. Looking back at this horrendous 
      school year, I think I've deserved just that.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But don't you worry. I'm full 
      with inspiration. I actually like to claim I haven't had so many new idea's 
      since I resumed updating back in July 2001. But as I said, the motivation 
      to do anything is &quot;a bit&quot; lacking right now. During my small holiday 
      I'll be answering your e-mails as usual and I'll be around at the Janitorial

      <font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm already preparing the upcoming 5th anniversary 
      of SpaceQuest.Net (25th October, 1998 - 25th October, 2003). I have this 
      cool idea in mind for an intro flash video but I lack the required skill 
      to pull off such project. So I'm asking for help. I'm looking for a guy 
      who knows a bit about flash (more than I do, which isn't all that much to 
      ask). I don't need no hacker, just somebody who knows a bit about it and 
      can make a decent thing or two. It would be nice if you can work with the 
      AGI and SCI editors because I want to extract some graphics from the SQ 
      games for the movie. If you want to work with me on this intro movie, please 
      contact me. I hope you can show me a piece of your work.</font></p>

      <font size="2" face="Verdana">I'd like to start with a small correction/addendum 
      for the new Space Quest 4 TV commercial. You might want to make a difference 
      between the term &quot;TV commercial&quot; and &quot;(national) broadcasted 
      TV commercial&quot;. This promo movie was most likely shown during computer 
      fairs. Or it might have played on a monitor inside several software stores. 
      Whether it was broadcasted on (national) television is unlikely. Little 
      information is available about this item so we may never know. But what 
      da heck, it's cool none the less.</font></p>

      Box page which now features home made scans of the Space Quest 1 EGA version 
      3 box (the one with the screen shot of Ulence Flats). Not only that, but 
      it so happens to be an ultra rare copy that has the Two Guys photo mirrored 
      by mistake. I recently aquired this item. Boy, how lucky can a guy get?</font></p>

      Alistair Gillett! SpaceQuest.Net is proud to be the first and only website 
      to offer a digitalized copy of the original: The Space Quest 4 TV commercial 
      which appeared in the winter of 1990, just before the christmas holidays! 
      It has been discovered just recently and strangly nobody knows where it 
      comes from. It's right there in the downloads page. Or just click here <font color="#CC0000">(1,4

      FAQ <font color="#CC0000">(87,2 KB)</font> is a massive document which contains 
      almost everything you want to know about Space Quest. Troels Pleimert, the 
      original writer, handed over the project to me. First I wanted to update 
      it but now I'm planning to implement it to this website. I would really 
      like to get some feedback from you about this one. Do you think I should 
      update the rest of the funfact pages too? Or don't you like it? Please let 
      me know by replying to the &quot;SQ FAQ Report 3&quot; thread at the Janitorial 
      Times. You'll find more information and my thoughts there too.</font></p>

      need any obscure plug-in for your video program.</font></p>

      have been made to re-establish contact with one of the God Fathers of the

      which seemed to originate far beyond our Quadrant, quite possibly from Scott 
      Murphy himself. But communications were lost not soon afterward. Maybe it 
      was a broken Large Distance Radio Array Relocator? A Subspace Dimension 
      Distortion Anomaly? Or maybe Scott just hit that good old &quot;BLOCK THIS 
      SPAM MESSAGE!&quot; button? We may never know. Brandon Klassen, drawn into

      Scott Murphy himself. While many of you might have your doubts about this, 
      I also sent that DEAD OR ALIVE pamphlet to his e-mail address on behalf 
      of the entire Space Quest Community. If that doesn't work, I don't know 
      what will. So stop mailing me those stupid questions. I don't know how Scott 
      is doing. I don't know if he had a gender change. I don't know if he wears 
      a diaper. I just know as much as you guys. Well, I know that SQ7.Org really

                    <font size="2">-- PlayStation 2, Xbox game? --</font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think we all agree Escape 
      Factory was working for Sierra on a Space Quest game. And if you don't take 
      my word for it (I know some mistrusted fans do for some reason) you can 
      find GameSpot articles, AdventureGamers articles and several other gamesite 
      articles all stating the same. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It's been about
        two months since Sierra told Escape Factory to stop making that new Space
        Quest game we were all dying to see. Recently I e-mailed James Gwertzman
        (founder of Escape Factory) who replied on April 1rst 2003 with a simple
        statement: <em>&quot;I'm afraid we can not talk about the project at
        all.&quot; </em> </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I had long
        ago concluded mailing Sierra or Escape Factory about the project is completely
        useless. Though this time I had high hopes that they might tell me something
        now that the project is cancelled. But no dice. I should have known because
        when I called Escape Factory myself on February 4 2003, I talked with
        an employee who told me they are under strict contract that forbids them
        to say anything. It's all up the publisher (supposed to be Sierra) to
        inform the public, announce anything and/or release information/material
        of the game. This contract that guy was talking about seems to run parallel
        with Sierra's policy to not comment on unreleased games. On the same
        day, Josh Mandel stepped forward stating:</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"><em>&quot;Given
          this news, I believe I'll step forward and tell you what little I know
          about the project. This information comes from a Sierra connection.</em></font></p>
    <p align="left"><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"> 1. While
          it used the Space Quest name, it was not an adventure game. <br>
  2. While it used the Space Quest name, it would've borne little, if any, resemblance
  to the SQ we know and love.</font></em></p>
    <p align="left"><em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"> Why? Because
          the team at Escape Factory was specifically told by Sierra NOT to even
          PLAY or LOOK AT the existing Space Quest games before working on the
          new game. Now, Escape Factory has some former Sierra employees, so
          it's likely that they brought some knowledge of the series to the table.
          How much prior information they were free to incorporate into the project,
          I don't know. However, it's clear that Sierra did NOT WANT the project
          to resemble the existing SQ games, let alone closely follow the canon.&quot;</font></em></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Mind you, </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"> this
        statement was precisely the complete opposite from what my sources told
        me: <em>&quot;All the developers involved have played the previous Space
        Quest games before they started designing. They are working very hard
        on the story at the moment.&quot;</em> It's not a matter of who you believe
        though, I'm just trying to point out the misinformation and secrecy surrounding
        the project.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">For </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"> 
      some it was hard to believe the game might not have been an adventure game 
      at all, but an action/strategy kind of thing. Recently, I've learned the 
      game wasn't going to be a PC game at all, but a PlayStation 2 or Xbox game. 
      This information comes from the FYE website who have stores all over America 
      selling computer games, DVD's, CD's and stuff. Sadly, just recently their 
      Space Quest page has been removed from their catalogue, but it was listed 
      there. Of course a would-be futile attempt to get more information about 
      all this was bluntly cut off. In a reply to an e-mail I sent to FYE: <em>&quot;In 
      reference to your email on the Space Quest game, I did some research on 
      the title. This is being provided to us from out content provider only. 
      Our games buyer has no information on it yet in our store system. I would 
      say this is most likely tentative at best currently as no other information 
      appears to be available. Please check back with the site as the content 
      will be updated as it becomes available to us. Hope this helps.&quot;</em></font></p>

        doesn't.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Space Quest
        fan Danny Bloks received an e-mail from Bruce Goodwill, Vivendi's Product
        Manager, who told him:<em> &quot;Sierra is looking at bringing out a
        Space Quest in Q4 2003 but this will be on the Console platform and not
        for PC unfortunately! I will forward you more information on the title
        as I receive it.&quot;</em></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In August 2002 
      SpaceQuest.Net talked about a new multiplayer chatroom project by Martin 
      Kool. His project has been completed some weeks ago and available to all. 
      He named it &quot;Good Old Adventures&quot; or GOA for short. The current 
      version doesn't include the amount of screen Martin promissed back in August, 
      but he assured me he's working on adding more of them. Hell, he already 
      released a cool developing kit, which you can use to create your own screens 
      and characters. From his website: <br>
                        <br>
    Good Old Adventures (GOA) is a FREE multi-user chatworld, based on the classic
    adventuregames made by Sierra On-Line in the '80s and '90s. GOA tries to
    let you relive those good old adventures, but this time with your friends.
    Play your favorite character and travel through your favorite adventure gaming
    world, meeting other fans as you move along.<br>
      <br>
    Right now, there is no real story or gaming element, and the number of rooms
    and playable actors isn't that big, but we do have several nice plans for
    the future (like minigames, multiplayer puzzles and inventory-related things).
    If time and income permit, of course. Also, you can contribute rooms yourself
    soon! Check out the Development Kit section for that! And of course, the
    GOA engine is capable of a whole lot more. Just because the current world
    only consists of the old blocky graphics that featured the original adventure
    games (made with Sierra's &quot;AGI&quot; engine), that doesn't mean we shouldn't
    go any further. Right now, the GOA engine offers all functionalities to recreate
    a whole new gaming world in the newer Sierra style called &quot;SCI&quot;,
    or even Lucasart's &quot;SCUMM&quot; style. Yes, you are reading it correctly,
    there is no problem into creating a multiplayer Day of the Tentacle where
    you can play Dr Fred, Guybrush Threepwood or Indiana Jones!<br>

    Good Old Adventures is built with an entirely new technology: it is called
    HTML which is short for HyperText Markup Language. It also uses some sort
    of programming language to make special things happen. This is called script
    and we use the &quot;javascript&quot; variant. There is also a Visual Basic
    scripting language. The communication between you and the other players requires
    no plug-ins whatsoever. No java applets, flash or other stuff needed. Just
    a browser that is listed in the following system requirements:<br>
      <br>
    SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS<br>
    For Windows:<br>
    * Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher<br>
    * Netscape 7 (or higher)<br>
    * Mozilla 1.0 or higher (or similar redesigns of Mozilla, like Phoenix)<br>
    <br>
    For MacIntosh users:<br>
    * Netscape 7 (or higher)<br>
    * Mozilla 1.0 or higher (or similar redesigns of Mozilla, like Phoenix)<br>
    <br>
    Other systems:<br>
    * Well, we expect most systems to use a Mozilla browser to be able to run
    GOA<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A guy named Douglas informed me of the Espace 
  Factory website update of January 27th, 2003 which I obviously missed! The website 
  reports:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><em>&quot;The not-yet-announced
      project was cancelled after just over a year of development for a variety
      of reasons. The team is obviously disappointed, but we understand the decision.
      We have terminated the relationship with our publisher amicably, and have
      once again begun the process of talking to other publishers about new projects,
      this time with a bigger and more experienced team.&quot;</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My sources have confirmed this &quot;not-yet-announced
    project&quot; was indeed the rumored Space Quest game. Whether Sierra has
    choosen a new developer for the game is unkown. Let's hope they did.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Looking back at the January 31rst
    update: This means the images found on the Escape Factory website DID belong
    to the secret Space Quest project after all. Also, James Gertzman statement
    was obviously not complete. They WERE working on a Space Quest game... </font></p>

    information about possible new Space Quest game<br>
                    <font size="2">-- the mystery deepens --</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daniel Hoeksema is working for a 
  university newspaper called the Western Herald (reaching an audience of around 
  35.000 people no less). He's currently working on an article about old computer 
  games and in a recent survey he found the Space Quest Series was by far the 
  most popular old game. He therefore decided to run a small article about the 
  Series and did a lot of research for it, which he agreed to share with SpaceQuest.Net. 
  Thank you Daniel!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">James Gertzman, president and co-founder 
  of Escape Factory, replied to Daniel regarding his questions about the rumored 
  new Space Quest game and stated black and white: &quot;I&#8217;ve heard the 
  rumors, but I&#8217;m afraid we are not working on a Space Quest game.&quot; 
  This is actually the first negative news we've heard regarding a possible new 
  Space Quest game. I can't imagine the president of such a company would lie 
  to a news reporter, so as far as I'm concerned this settles the matter. The 
  rumors regarding Escape Factory must be wrong. This also means the design art 
  which was uncovered not too long ago from the Escape Factory website DOES NOT 
  belong to the rumored Space Quest project.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daniel also sent an e-mail to Sierra's
    official press contact and received the reply: &quot;Sierra does not comment
    on titles that have not been announced.&quot; This is basically the same
    reply I got several times in the past from Sierra. The most recent reply
    I got from Sierra (dating back to January 17): &quot;I don't have any information
    to share with you at this time. I'm sorry - I wish I did.&quot; These two
    statements might add extra weight to Mr. Gertzman statement, but to me Sierra
    still isn't denying that they aren't working on a Space Quest game. And that's
    saying something.</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Disappointing as this all might sound to you, Nicodemus 
Caine (a Space Quest fan some of you might know from the SubSpace Channel, who 
is known as Greywolfe there), has uncovered an interesting advert in a gaming 
magazine only days ago. It is taken from &quot;New Age Gaming&quot; (January edition) 
and is located somewhere in the back (on page 59 if you care to know). The original 
is in colour and the banner reads: &quot;2003 doesn't have to be all doom and 
gloom.&quot; (click on the image on the left for a close up <font color="#CC0000">156 
KB</font>). It seems to feature a list of titles which, Nicodemus presumes, will 
be due for release somewhere this year. Between all the usual uninteresting upcoming 
Sierra and Blizzard (also a division of Vivendi) shoot'em up titles (I mean RPG 
titles) are the two magical words &quot;Space Quest&quot;. It is believed the 
company responsible for the ad, Comztek, is the only South African distributor 
for Vivendi Universal.</font> 
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To top it all of: some rumours appeared 
  that Microsoft has bought, or will buy, Vivendi Universal's entire gaming division. 
  Sierra Entertainment is of course part of that very division. These are only 
  rumours and let's hope for the sake of the gaming industry they will remain 
  just that.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There you have it folks. The world 
  is once again leaving us Space Quest fans confused and without answers. Though 
  I'd like to add that we must be cautious not to misinterpret the little bit 
  of information we receive. Please share your thoughts at the Roger Wilco TalkSpot, 
  SpaceQuest.Net's message board. What a day! I think I need a new brain.</font></p>
