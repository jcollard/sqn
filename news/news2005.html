Still hanging out  I see? Good, good. Some things are worth wasting your time on. I mean, some things are worth fighting for. Well, I don't have an  update for you today but a small news bulletin to keep you all up to date with the latest news of our little gaming community.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Vohaul Strikes Back fanproject updated their website today with a notice about a small miss claim. Go check it out. If you don't know yet what &quot;Vohaul Strikes Back&quot; exactly is then do check out their website. It's a very promising fangame, scheduled for release somewhere in.... Uhhhm... The future. Yeah, that's it.</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Janitorial Times member New Rising Sun released a new version of his comprehensive SQ4CD update. In his own words:&bull; Added room of &quot;stuff removed for legal reasons&quot; (no speech there). <br>
&bull; Readded removed Radio Shock products (sorry, no speech for them).<br>
&bull; Added &quot;Stunt Flyer&quot; and &quot;Dacron Danny&quot; bargain bin games. <br>
&bull; Added priority information to sound resources. <br>
&bull; Orbs now emit sound during captiveScript sequence. <br>
&bull; Removed volume change during speech output. If the music is too loud, lower the volume in the game's control panel. <br>
&bull; Fixed scrolling in the video driver. <br>
&bull; RESOURCE.000 is no longer PKDCL-compressed. This means shorter loading times for DosBox users and yields better compression ratios for the .zip archive as a whole.</font>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please note that my frans at spacequest.net address is no longer in use. I finally got bored of all the junk e-mails. The contact page has been updated accordingly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A big personal &quot;thank you&quot; goes out to Eric 
  Weidenbacher, who recently sent me a genuine Roland LAPC-1 sound card as a sign of appreciation for my website. Now, how cool is that, thanks mate! I love getting packages through snail mail, so don't be shy and send  your anthrax and death threads. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, next month I'll be leaving for England to get my bachalor degree in Multimedia Technology. Very exciting indeed. I never dared dreaming of doing a university study. But hey, if Roger Wilco managed to get a Captain rank, I might as well pull it off. </font></p>

  <font color="#000000"><img src="sqn.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="90" height="90" hspace="5" align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm back to bring you the latest Space Quest related stuff, just when you started to accept the idea of SpaceQuest.Net being &quot;dead&quot;. I've updated the following pages today: SQ5 spoof &amp; references (3 new), SQ5 plot inconsistency (2 new), SQ6 spoof &amp; reference (1 new) and one new fan image. Do check it out. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the way, the artist who made the new fan image is now a member of the Space Quest 3 remake project which is alive and kicking. I'm their &quot;creative consultant&quot; - just so as you know! I haven't heard much from the Vohaul Strikes Back or the SQ7.Org fangame teams. A new website called &quot;Fanventures&quot; seems to be on top of things, having released information about the SQ3 project, Vohaul Strikes Back and about SQ7.Org. On a last Community note, there's a new website called &quot;the Space Quest Omnipedia&quot; - a huge SQ database. You can help building it. Submit anything SQ related that isn't on there. Hell, there's stuff on there that isn't even on SpaceQuest.Net. Quite remarkable!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, SpaceQuest.Net was under ESA investigation a few weeks ago. What this means is that this institute demanded the removal of the games downloads, per Vivendi's request (Vivendi is of course the legal owner of Sierra and Space Quest). Former Sierra CEO Mike Ryder did give SpaceQuest.Net permission to publish the games back in 2001. Sadly, this didn't convince the ESA. No matter, we worked things out. Though, I must share something with you. I learned the ESA and Vivendi were tipped by an individual who thought it was necessary to play moral Joe. Quite amazing how one fool can ruin things for 13,000 others. Mind, that's exactly how people got caught sixty years ago by the Gestapo. Bless our little snitch. Let's hope he's happy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's it for today, folks! It's good to be back even though the update is rather small.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've
  removed a few funfacts because they were simply not true.
  Yikes, I think this is the first time I actually had to remove

      new SQ5 Spoof &amp; Reference and a
        new SQ4 funfact. Surely we fans found out every silly joke

<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly:
  new to the website is the Russian version of SQ1EGA and SQ2.
  We actually
  served less people in February then we did in March so its my
  duty to ask you to be gentle with the game downloads pages.
  There are a lot of people
  who wish to use this feature so download only one game package.
  You simply don't need all the different versions and languages.
  All the packages work so please download  one file only. If people

  Huge Pile of Updates </strong></font><font color="#6666FF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-
    News: Tuesday, February 15, 2005</em></font><br>
  <font color="#000000"><img src="sq3vgasketch.gif" alt="SpaceQuest.Net" width="90" height="90" hspace="5" align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've
      been extremely busy since the start of 2005 and it looks like
      this is only the beginning. The workload of my school is really
      piling up. I'm investing around 60 to 80 hours each week
      in school stuff. Yeah, you heard me right. Though don't be sorry
      for me.
      I really enjoy it, but it consumes a bucket load of energy. It's
      therefore not very surprising that my available time for SpaceQuest.Net is
      almost non-existing. I'm afraid things will get worse in the
      future. I'll be trying to start my very own company somewhere
      in the third quarter this year. Excuse me for sounding over-dramatic,
      but it looks as though my youth has finally come to an end. Blimey,
      it took me a fair few years! It's not a decision you make overnight
      to &quot;move on&quot;. It happens gradually. You may have concluded by
      now what the implications are for SpaceQuest.Net.
      Rest assured, I won't stop updating. But I must ask you for more
      patience. Updates will be a bit sparse. We'll see what the future
      brings and we'll meet it when it does. No need to worry about
      anything right now, we'll take it one step at a time. I still
      find it quite amazing we have new updates at all! After all,
      SQ6 hit
      the shelves back in 1996/1997. If somebody told me in advance
      that I would still be updating in 2005, I would
      have called them crazy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before
  I start listing today's update, I'd like to announce Eperfect.net,
  our generous sponsor, has donated an extra 60 gigabytes of bandwidth
  to SpaceQuest.Net,
  free of charge! This means the website is adequately equiped
  to house around 20,000 unique visitors each month (we're getting
  over 12,000 right now). This also means the games downloads are
  available a bit longer. The games.spacequest.net account has
  been upgraded by 30 gigabytes, making up a total of 200 gigabytes
  extremely high quality bandwidth! Simply mind
  boggling. Still, this is being consumed by you guys within 15
  days.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
  was able to update SpaceQuest.Net today
  thanks to a great number of contributions. A special thanks to
  the members and guests of the  Janitorial
    Times! The following pages have been updated today:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
  custom sq computer article contains a new, rather short,
  explanation about which soundcards produce the best results
  for use with the Space Quest Series. No biggie, but it's a
  must read if you're interested in building your own vintage
  gaming computer specifically build for the Space Quest Series.
  Finally, I've added some additional VGA screen shots to the Space
    Quest 1 Screenshot page. Thanks to Space Quest fan &quot;RDSF&quot;.
  I've added a new contribution to the &quot;Cancelled
    Stuff&quot; section of Space Quest 3. The Space Quest 4 &quot;Spoof
      and Reference&quot; page has been updated with four new
  additions! Now how cool is that? Then we have two new additions
  to the Space
    Quest 1 Funfacts page and two new Space
      Quest 5 Spoof and References. Lasty, one new Space Quest 6 plot inconsistency.
  New contributions are accompanied by a &quot;NEW&quot; image
  for easy reference. I've added one great new image to the
    fanfiction section. It was made by Akril. But that's not
  all what's new today.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Space
  Quest fan &quot;New Rising Sun&quot; who
  brought us the excellent patches for those nasty <a href="misc/timerissues/index.shtml">timer
    issues</a> has released an update for the Space Quest 4 CD-Rom
  version. This is what he has to say:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Against
  my better judgment, I am hereby releasing an update to the CD-ROM
  version of Space Quest IV. This update changes the game into
  the state it should have been, in my opinion, in 1994. Changes
  include: <br>
  - superior graphics, taken from the floppy version <br>
  - ability to hear speech and read text at the same time <br>
  - correct timing <br>
  - various bug fixes <br>
  The windows interpreter &quot;SCIWV&quot; is neither included nor supported.
  Don't use previous saved games. The version number has been changed from
  1.0 to 1.1.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Installation
  instructions:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With
  the replacement of nearly every single graphics resource, the
  usual &quot;patch&quot; distribution method is inadequate; instead,
  the full game, minus the audio file, is included. Extract the
  .zip archive into an empty directory. Open the RESOURCE.CFG file
  with a text editor and change the path specification after &quot;audio
  =&quot; to the CD-ROM or hard disk directory where the RESOURCE.AUD
  file resides.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's
  a discussion at the Janitorial Times about this new update. New Rising Sun's new update is available

  Strikes Back Status Report </strong></font><font color="#6666FF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>-
News &amp; Update: Wednesday, January 5, 2005</em></font><br>
<font color="#000000"><img src="pickaxe.gif" alt="A Pick Axe" width="90" height="90" hspace="5" align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What
  if the hovercraft that took Roger to the Orium Mines didn't
  run out of fuel? Fanproject &quot;Vohaul's Mines&quot; has just
  opened their new
    website and has released a trailer. The trailer shows
  the basic plot (which is based upon a
    fanfictional story I wrote for SpaceQuest.Net)
and shows the general look and feel of the actual game. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After
  seeing this trailer, what conclusions can we make? Parhaps quite
  a few. My first impression is positive. I caught my 21-year-old-self
  feeling
  rather excited upon seeing the first original screen
  the team made. The graphics are very decent and I was glad to
  notice only a few graphics and animations taken from the original
  games. Some screens from The
    Lost Chapter and Replicated were
  taken from the original games and modified a bit. No challenge
  there. Let's hope Vohaul's Mines chooses to use hand-made backgrounds
  rather than plundering the original sourcecode of early Space
  Quest games.
  Vonster D Monster, designer of The Lost Chapter, is doing part-time
  work for the team, thus making his huge experience available
  to the Vohaul's Mines team. This alone should give the project
  a headstart in programming and in artwork. The team entrusted
  me with with some early in-game screenshots which really impressed
  me. Sadly, I'm not allowed to share those pictures with you.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="sq2shot.gif" alt="Screenshot Space Quest 2" width="302" height="155" hspace="5" align="left">Yet
  despite all this praise, it is clear when looking at the trailer
  that this project hasn't yet gone through what I like to call
  its &quot;professionalization phase&quot;, which is a phase all
  fanprojects must go through one time or another . A phase all
  fanprojects must go through one time or another. It is clear
  that this fanproject
  has potential (no denying that), but it shares flaws with TLC.
  The backgrounds are missing detail and atmosphere: two very important
  elements that make scenes realistic and immersive. Instead, these
  are simply pretty pictures without the SQ soul. You probably
  ask yourself how it's possible to make 16 colour low resolution
  graphics immersive? Well, can you remember how Scott and Mark
  achieved this? By creating an old shoe box diorama-like view.
  Vohaul's Mines clearly misses this.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My
  second point of criticism of the trailer is the frequency of
  misspellings and improper grammar, as well as the overuse of
  descriptions. It comes close to being a pain. Not everything
  needs
  words to explain what's happening. For instance, we can all see
  the Apeman reaching behind the counter but why do we need the
  text that follows? It's as if the designers are scared their
  audience
  will miss things. In over-doing the textboxes a bit, they are
  exactly the opposite of what I think they're trying to do: Be
  clear and
  understandable. It can be said
  the project clearly misses somebody who's good with the ol' fashion
  pen. The descriptions are straight forward,
  dry, without humor and full with grammar mistakes. I know I'm
  being rather strict here. We must not forget we're seeing a 
  very early look of the game, but that shouldn't keep the team
  from striving for perfection. Text and dialogue is what made
  the old Sierra games stand out. If there are any mistakes in
  the texts, people will most certainly judge the game for it.
  I therefore advise the  team to look into this matter more closely
  before they release the actual game.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is
  it fair to conclude THAT much from the trailer? It might sound
  to you like I'm axing this project. But I'm not. I think this
  project has truck loads of potential. It seems like they're avoiding
  the typical fangame route. Which is a good thing. They're not
  doing a new SQ. No, they're doing an <em>alternative</em> SQ
  which will start and end exactly the same as the original game
  thus not being an obstruction to the SQ timeline. It takes true
  talent to be able to tackle a fancreation like that.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What
  if the hovercraft that took Roger to the mines didn't crash?
  Coming as soon as possible. The trailer is available on their
  website or here at SpaceQuest.Net.</font></p>

    <font color="#000000"><img src="vsbupdate.gif" alt="Vohaul Strikes Back" width="90" height="90" hspace="5" align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today's
  update is quite small but nice. New are two excellent features.
  First is the XML news feed available for SpacQuest.Net.
  It has been online for testing purposes for several days but
  today I'm announcing it officially.
  Second is a new page called &quot;Link
  to Us&quot;. I've been working on some cool banners and buttons
  about my website for those people out there who want to link
to my website. Let's move on to the community news.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
  Vohaul Strikes Back fanproject has released a new status update.
  They're in dire need for new character artists! Project Leader
  PCJ explains:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After
  several months of the character art department standing still
  (the reasons for which are explained
  below), we've finally got
  things off the ground again. We've chosen a relatively simple
  style for the characters, which would allow us to recruit
  more artists in addition to the two we already have (Justas and
  Tiki). We're going to use Macromedia Flash to create 2D sprites
  and
  animations, examples of which can be seen on our
    website. If
      you think you (or somebody you know) could create similar animations
and is willing to work for free, let us know!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> OVERALL - 
  Work on the game has still been proceeding as usual. A bit slower since September
  as most of the team still attends a school or a college, but at least the development
  has been steady and there are no signs of even the slightest thought of cancelling
  the project. The main reason for which being Marty's backgrounds which would
  be impossible to simply throw away, due to their infinite awesomeness.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> CHARACTER
  SPRITES -             In the previous status report, we noted
  that Kain took some time off after several conflicts in the team.
  However, he managed
  to disappear completely
  once again
  and we haven't seen him around for half a year, so we've decided to remove
  him from the team line-up. It wasn't an easy decision as all the character
  model
  files were only on his computer, so our only choice was to start from scratch.
  Later, Tiki joined the team as the new character artist, but he turned out
  to be quite busy with other projects. So it soon became clear that he can't
  do all
  the work alone and the only way to go is to choose a simple style and try
  to recruit more artists to reduce individual workload. The
  new style was developed
  by Justas, who is now also one of the character artists.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WRITING
  - Writing is coming along quite nicely. We've made a lot of progress,
  come up with new ideas and figured out many problems. The
  team was expanded once again
  as
  Karmot, a fellow Estonian, offered his services as a puzzle creation assistant
  after having noticed an interview with the VSB team that was published at
  JustAdventure in early December.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> BACKGROUNDS - 
  Apart from what I've said in the overall section, there's not
  much to add. Marty is still popping out new backgrounds
  and touching up / editing older
  ones wherever
  necessary. Despite him claiming himself to be lazy, he actually tends to
  be always way ahead in the schedule, compared to the rest of us.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="ss2.jpg" alt="Vohaul Strikes Back Fangame Screenshot" width="326" height="250"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> MUSIC
  AND CODING -             We haven't had much progress in these
  areas, but they're mainly scheduled for later phases of the development
  anyway. MusicallyInspired
  has returned
  after
  a long absence and will be continuing his work. BlueMax has sorted out
  his software problems and should also be able to begin composing soon.
  We haven't
  started
  with coding yet, as character sprites are necessary to make any demos
  and we haven't had any of those for a long time.</font></p>
