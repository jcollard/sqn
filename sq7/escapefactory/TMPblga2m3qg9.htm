              <a href="http://www.adventuregamers.com" target="_blank">Adventure 
              Gamers</a> released the following news: &quot;Two reliable sources 
              have shared with us that an independent studio is working on a Space 
              Quest game for Sierra, possibly a remake. Recent changes to Sierra's 
              website already seemed to hint at this, but it wasn't until now 
              that we've gotten confirmation that a new Space Quest game is indeed 
              going to happen.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, 
              <a href="http://www.gamespot.com" target="_blank">GameSpot</a> came 
              with the following news on their website that very same day: &quot;Sierra 
              may soon announce a seventh game in its humorous sci-fi adventure 
              series. GameSpot has learned from sources working on the project 
              that Sierra is developing a new game in its classic Space Quest 
              sci-fi adventure game series. Although no further information about 
              the game is available at this point, the publisher may be gearing 
              up to announce the game, as it recently launched a new Space Quest 
              website, which contains descriptions of the previous Space Quest 
              games along with a large Space Quest logo. All of the previous Space 
              Quest games are listed as &quot;temporarily out of stock,&quot; 
              which suggests that the new website isn't simply intended to boost 
              sales of the older games, but perhaps to serve as home for a new 
              one. The Space Quest series began in 1987, and the sixth game in 
              the series was released in 1995. Sierra announced in 1998 that it 
              was putting development of the seventh Space Quest game on hold 
              indefinitely, but now there are indications that the project has 
              been revived. A Sierra representative declined comment when asked 
              about the upcoming game. We'll post more information about the game 
              as it becomes available.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

              He has several of the old games back in development, and is meeting 
              with several of the old designers to explore their possible involvement. 
              I think it's great! My only concern is that I hope that they are 
              able to find something new and exciting to do with the old series, 
              and don't just continue them as they were. I like things that use 
              the old characters, and the worlds that we created, but that somehow 
              move entertainment forward in some way. I can't say exactly which 
              series are in development, because he wouldn't want me to.</font></p>

              2 months ago. He said we should meet again soon to complete discussions. 
              I told him any time. (I only live about 10 minutes away)... I've 
              heard nothing. He did tell PCGamer that &quot;a new game was in 
              development&quot;. I don't know what that means, as I'm not working 
              on it. Perhaps he found someone &quot;better&quot; for the job (i.e., 
              cheaper?). Actually, I'm having a great time with retirement. You 
              know how fun it is to go on vacation, and how the last day you'll 
              all bummed out because you have to go back to school or work? Well, 
              retirement is like summer vacation... without that last day! He 
              did tell me that a totally different group of developers were working 
              on a SQ sequel. It will be interesting to see how that turns out,

              the well known adventure brand names and is currently working on 
              two secret projects that are based on introduced titles. &quot;It 
              is really amazing how often German PC gamers tell us they want a 
              new Leisure Suite Larry, King's Quest, Space Quest and Police Quest. 
              The adventure genre which we knew back then may not be viable in 
              this form, but you can transport these game themes with other genres 
              like action or strategy.&quot; Says Sierra's Mike Ryder. Both projects 
              are planned to be released in 2003 or 2004 and will probably be 
              unveiled at the E3 in Los Angeles. One of these two project may 
              be an action oriented multi-platform console title and the other 
              a PC strategy game.&quot;</font></p>

              even uncovered this highly classified clay model (see picture) for 
              a possible character in the game. Naturally, we blocked his eyes

              is no longer accessible on the internet). The page now features 
              demo's for some of the Space Quest games and an &quot;ORDER NOW&quot; 
              link <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001OWYP/ref%3Dnosim/sierra04-20/002-1725631-1168866" target="_blank">to 
              a page on the Amazon store</a> that offers the Space Quest Collection 
              (Amazon takes care of Sierra's online sales). The collection is 
              out of stock, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it becoming available 
              soon. I'm extremely pleased to see the price has been set for well 
              under $20 US. Although we haven't heard either good or bad news 
              about the possible new Space Quest game lately, I think this is 
              great news indeed. The Space Quest page indicates Sierra is putting 
              time (and thus money) into the Series again!</font></p>

                far the most popular old game. He therefore decided to run a small

              but I&#8217;m afraid we are not working on a Space Quest game.&quot; 
              This is actually the first negative news we've heard regarding a 
              possible new Space Quest game. I can't imagine the president of 
              such a company would lie to a news reporter, so as far as I'm concerned 
              this settles the matter. The rumors regarding Escape Factory must 
              be wrong. This also means the design art which was uncovered not 
              to long ago from the <a href="http://www.escapefactory.com" target="_blank">Escape

              been announced.&quot; This is basically the same reply I got several 
              times in the past from Sierra. The most recent reply I got from 
              Sierra (dating back to January 17): &quot;I don't have any information 
              to share with you at this time. I'm sorry - I wish I did.&quot; 
              These two statements might add extra weight to Mr. Gertzman statement, 
              but to me Sierra still isn't denying that they aren't working on 
              a Space Quest game. And that's saying something.</font></p>

              as this all might sound to you, Space Quest fan Nicodemus Caine 
              has uncovered an interesting advert in a gaming magazine only days 
              ago. It is taken from &quot;New Age Gaming&quot; (January edition) 
              and is located somewhere in the back (on page 59 if you care to 
              know). The original is in colour and the banner reads: &quot;2003 
              doesn't have to be all doom and gloom&quot;. You can click on the 
              image for a close up. It seems to feature a list of titles which, 
              Nicodemus presumes, will be due for release somewhere this year. 
              Between all the usual uninteresting upcoming Sierra and Blizzard 
              (also a division of Vivendi) shoot'em up titles (I mean RPG titles) 
              are the two magical words &quot;Space Quest&quot;. It is believed 
              the company responsible for the ad, Comztek, is the only South African 
              distributor for Vivendi Universal.</font></p>

              project was cancelled after just over a year of development for 
              a variety of reasons. The team is obviously disappointed, but we 
              understand the decision. We have terminated the relationship with 
              our publisher amicably, and have once again begun the process of 
              talking to other publishers about new projects, this time with a

            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My

              a new developer for the game is unkown. Let's hope they did. Looking 
              back at the January 31rst update: This means the images found on 
              the Escape Factory website DID belong to the secret Space Quest 
              project after all. James Gertzman statement was obviously not complete. 
              They WERE working on a Space Quest game...</font></p>

              I think we all agree Escape Factory was working for Sierra on a 
              Space Quest game.<font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's 
              been about two months since Sierra told Escape Factory to stop making 
              that new Space Quest game we were all dying to see. Recently I e-mailed 
              James Gwertzman (founder of Escape Factory) who replied on April 
              1rst 2003 with a simple statement: &quot;I'm afraid we can not talk 
              about the project at all.&quot;<em> </em> </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              had long ago concluded mailing Sierra or Escape Factory about the 
              project is completely useless. Though this time I had high hopes 
              that they might tell me something now that the project is cancelled. 
              But no dice. I should have known because when I called Escape Factory 
              myself on February 4 2003, I talked with an employee who told me 
              they are under strict contract that forbids them to say anything. 
              It's all up the publisher (supposed to be Sierra) to inform the 
              public, announce anything and/or release information/material of 
              the game. This contract that guy was talking about seems to run 
              parallel with Sierra's policy to not comment on unreleased games. 
              On the same day, Josh Mandel stepped forward stating:</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Given 
              this news, I believe I'll step forward and tell you what little 
              I know about the project. This information comes from a Sierra connection.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              1. While it used the Space Quest name, it was not an adventure game. 
              <br>
              2. While it used the Space Quest name, it would've borne little, 
              if any, resemblance to the SQ we know and love.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Why? Because the team at Escape Factory was specifically told by 
              Sierra NOT to even PLAY or LOOK AT the existing Space Quest games 
              before working on the new game. Now, Escape Factory has some former 
              Sierra employees, so it's likely that they brought some knowledge 
              of the series to the table. How much prior information they were 
              free to incorporate into the project, I don't know. However, it's 
              clear that Sierra did NOT WANT the project to resemble the existing 
              SQ games, let alone closely follow the canon.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mind 
              you, this statement was precisely the complete opposite from what 
              my sources told me: &quot;All the developers involved have played 
              the previous Space Quest games before they started designing. They 
              are working very hard on the story at the moment.&quot; It's not 
              a matter of who you believe though, I'm just trying to point out 
              the misinformation and secrecy surrounding the project.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
              some it was hard to believe the game might not have been an adventure 
              game at all, but an action/strategy kind of thing. Recently, I've 
              learned the game wasn't going to be a PC game at all, but a PlayStation 
              2 or Xbox game. This information comes from the <a href="http://www.fye.com" target="_blank">FYE 
              website</a> who have stores all over America selling computer games, 
              DVD's, CD's and stuff. Sadly, just recently their Space Quest page 
              has been removed from their catalogue, but it was listed there. 
              Of course a would-be futile attempt to get more information about 
              all this was bluntly cut off. In a reply to an e-mail I sent to 
              FYE: &quot;In reference to your email on the Space Quest game, I 
              did some research on the title. This is being provided to us from 
              our content provider only. Our games buyer has no information on 
              it yet in our store system. I would say this is most likely tentative 
              at best currently as no other information appears to be available. 
              Please check back with the site as the content will be updated as 
              it becomes available to us. Hope this helps.&quot; And it sure doesn't.</font></p>
